These benefits include reduced printing and handling costs and an overall reduction in filing burden for the respondents, and a reduction in file processing and maintenance costs incurred by the Commission.  

II.	BACKGROUND
Forms 2 and 2-A
2.	Forms 2 and 2-A data are collected pursuant to Sections 8 and 10 of the Natural Gas Act (NGA).  Section 8 of the NGA gives the Commission the authority to issue regulations and rules requiring accounts, records, and memoranda.  Section 10 of the NGA gives the Commission authority through rules and regulations to require periodic and special reports. 
3.	Forms 2 and 2-A collect general corporate information that includes:  summary financial information, balance sheet and income statement supporting information, gas plant, operating expenses and statistical data.  The information is used in the continuous review of the financial condition of jurisdictional companies, in various rate proceedings and in the Commission's audit program.  Forms 2 and 2-A data are also used to compute annual charges which are assessed against each jurisdictional natural gas pipeline and which are necessary to recover the Commission's annual costs.   

4.	Form 2 is filed by respondents determined to be ""Major Gas Companies"" under the Commission's jurisdiction.  A utility is defined as a ""Major Gas Company@ if it meets one of the following requirements: having combined gas sold for resale and gas transported or stored for a fee that exceeds 50 million Dth in each of the three previous calendar years.  For the Form 2-A, a respondent is defined as a ""Non Major Natural Gas Company@ if it meets the following requirement: has total annual volume transactions exceeding 200,000 Dekatherms (Dth) in each of the three previous calendar years and it is not classified as AMajor.@  
5.	The Forms 2 and 2-A are annual submissions from approximately 62 and 48, jurisdictional natural gas companies, respectively.  Earlier this year, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approved 3-year extensions for both Forms.  The Commission's Forms 2 and 2-A filing requirements are found at 18 CFR '' 260.1 and 260.2. 
Form 6

6.	In 1977, the responsibility to regulate oil pipeline companies was transferred to the Commission from the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC).   In accordance with the transfer of authority, the Commission was delegated the responsibility under Section 1 of the Interstate Commerce Act to regulate the rates and charges for transportation of oil by pipeline and establish valuation of those pipelines, and under Section 20 of that Act to require pipelines to file annual reports of information necessary to exercise its statutory responsibilities.

Calculation of Control Area Hourly System Lambda

Indianapolis Power & Light Company’s system incremental cost curve is produced by combining the unit incremental fuel, variable scrubber, and emission allowance cost curves for all on-line generating units. The unit incremental cost curves consist of seven piecewise linear megawatt breakpoints each with an associated incremental cost.

The system incremental cost curve is constructed by summing the megawatt breakpoints of all units in ascending order of equal incremental costs including fuel, variable scrubber, and emission allowances.

ECONOMIC DISPATCH WITH MULTIPLE FUEL PRICES

FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION

The proposed Economic Dispatch software enhancement is designed to provide the capability for Chugach to economically dispatch their generation subject to these additional constraints:

	When gas flow at Beluga exceeds a specified amount, all additional gas is provided at a different price from the base load gas.  

	Dispatch power for incremental sales to GVEA on top of Chugach generation at a different price from the Chugach fuel price. 

IMPLEMENTATION

The new Economic Dispatch uses the existing algorithm, as described in the attached appendix, to perform the basic dispatch.  However, the overall economic dispatch is now performed in three passes.  These three passes are designated Base dispatch, Secondary dispatch and GVEA dispatch.  The sequence of calculation is given below:

Base Dispatch

Set load to actual load less the GVEA load.  Use actual unit limits and the base fuel price.

Dispatch the generation to meet the load.
     
Secondary Dispatch

	If Beluga gas exceeds the base gas consumption limit:

Dispatch to the base gas limit

Set the low limits to the dispatched unit outputs.  Use the secondary fuel prices.

Dispatch the generation to meet the load.

GVEA DISPATCH

Set load to actual load, including the GVEA load.  Set the low limits to the dispatched unit outputs.  Use the GVEA fuel prices.

Dispatch the generation to meet the load.

METHOD OF CALCULATION

The coordination equations to be solved by EDC are:

(CJ * df/dpj + Imj) * PFj = LAMBDA

Where:  Cj	     = Fuel cost for the jth unit.

             dfj/dpj         = Incremental heat rate for the jth unit.

             IMj               = Incremental maintenance cost for the jth unit.

             PFj               = Penalty Factor for the jth unit.
                                     Used to bias entire unit cost.

             LAMBDA     = Incremental cost of supplying power to a hypothetical load center of the 
                                      area.

LES also owns a 100MW share of a coal fired plant outside the service area that is delivered via pseudo tie with an energy cost of under $12/MWh. LES output of these resources are based on a percent of available generation with minimum and maximum requirements. In addition LES has two long term firm contracts for energy from network resources outside the Balancing Authority Area for a total of about 128MW. One of these schedules is delivered via dynamic scheduling, and is taken load pattern.

Calculation of System lambda

The goal of economic dispatch is to make the Area Control Error (ACE) zero at the lowest total cost.  For a given system generation requirement, the cheapest operating point occurs where the incremental power cost (lambda) for each controllable unit are equal.  The mathematical derivation proving the merits of equal lambda dispatch may be found in most power system analysis text books.  The controller must therefore be able to find the right system lambda and the desired generation of each unit at that lambda.

Equal lambda dispatch at Progress Energy Carolinas is achieved with the use of unit incremental heat rate curves, fuel costs and penalty factors for transmission losses.  The incremental cost curve for each generating unit is the product of the incremental heat rate curve multiplied by the unit fuel cost and adjusted by the penalty factor to account for transmission losses.  While attempting to maintain an ACE of zero, thus serving load commitments, each unit’s incremental cost curve is set equal to the system incremental cost (lambda) to determine unit output (MW).  As load increases and ACE moves in the positive direction, a new system lambda is selected in an effort to match generation with load.  An iterative process of selecting lambda and determining unit output until ACE is brought to zero is employed constantly on the Energy Management System.  As load diminishes and ACE moves in the negative direction, again, a new system lambda is selected and unit incremental cost curves evaluated to match generation with load.

Per Instructions on Part II - Schedule 6

PNM Balancing Authority Economic Dispatch

Since there are no agreements for PNM economic dispatch of non-PNM generation resources within the PNM Balancing Authority, each utility within the PNM Balancing Authority independently performs economic dispatch of their own generation resources.  The majority of PNM Balancing Authority generation resources belong to PNM.  PNM generation resources are economically dispatched as follows:

 1.  PNM Palo Verde nuclear generation is the lowest cost PNM generation resource.  It is also very undesirable to curtail Palo Verde nuclear generation from a plant operations perspective.  Therefore, PNM Palo Verde generation is always run at its full capability. 

2.  PNM Four Corners generation is usually PNM's second lowest cost generation resource.  It is typically fully loaded, except when PNM load commitments are so low that Four Corners generation must be curtailed in order to keep the PNM Area Control Error at zero.  On occasion, when San Juan is lightly loaded, its incremental cost is less than Four Corners.  In those instances Four Corners generation is economically curtailed.

3.  PNM San Juan generation is typically the next lowest cost PNM generation resource.  That generation is on Automatic Generation Control to follow swings in PNM area control error (ACE).   PNM ownership of San Juan units is spread over four units.  PNM's Energy Management System (EMS) is equipped with an economic dispatch function.  

4.  PNM has a purchase from Southwestern Public Service Co. (SPS) that has an energy price, which varies on a monthly basis.  That energy price is historically above the San Juan incremental energy generation cost.

5.  PNM owns one third of the Luna Energy Facility.  This is a two on one combined cycle gas unit with an optimum heat rate of 7,200.  The Luna unit is on Automatic Generation Control (AGC) and is dispatched on an economic basis after the SPS contract.  

6. Lordsburg Generating Station is a gas only turbine located in southern New Mexico, owned and operated by PNM.  It is started for load or for spinning reserves resources, provided transmission is purchased to the delivery point, and for energy sales, if its operating costs are within the range of spot market costs.

7.  PNM Reeves  is a gas plant located in Albuquerque.  It is started for load, for spinning reserves resources, for loadside used for transmission support, and for energy sales, if its operating costs are within the range of spot market costs.

8.  Delta-Person is a gas/oil plant located in Albuquerque.  Its total output is purchased by PNM and is dispatched economically, usually after Reeves generation. When on line, Delta-Person is on Automatic Generation Control to follow swings in PNM area control error (ACE).  It is started for load or for loadside used for transmission support.

9.  Afton Generating Station is a gas/oil plant located in southern New Mexico, owned and operated by PNM, and is dispatched economically, usually after Delta-Person generation.

10.  Additional generation resources include PNM Las Vegas Combustion Turbine generation and PNM purchases from other utilities.


PNM System Lambda Calculation

Since PNM is not able to economically dispatch non-PNM Balancing Authority generation resources, the System Lambda calculation only includes PNM generation resources.  If generation resources having an incremental fuel cost less than the calculated San Juan lambda are being curtailed, the PNM Real Time Power Trader manually schedules the lower cost resource to replace the higher lambda San Juan resource.  The calculated San Juan lambda value is manually replaced with the lower value.  If the PNM San Juan generation resource is fully scheduled, except for unloaded capacity needed for regulation and spinning reserves, and PNM is using generation resources having a higher incremental fuel cost (such as purchased energy with a higher cost than the San Juan lambda), the PNM Real Time Power Trader replaces the previously calculated lambda value with the cost of the next incremental generation resource available to PNM.

PGE does not use an economic dispatch algorithm for demand following. PGE’s control area uses hydroelectric generating units for demand following. The following discussion describes PGE’s 2006 control area resources and how it dispatches them to meet its control area demand.

PGE’s Resources

PGE control area resources include: eight wholly owned hydroelectric generating plants, the purchase of the output of four hydroelectric generating plants, two jointly owned coal-fired generating plants, two wholly owned combined cycle combustion turbine plants, one PURPA contract thermal generating plant, one PURPA contract hydroelectric generating plant, three non-PURPA contract hydroelectric generating plants and one non-utility thermal generating plant.

Dispatch of PGE’s Resources

Demand following is accomplished by sending the AGC signal either directly to the one of the units of PGE’s Round Butte hydroelectric generating plant or to the control center which coordinates the operation of PGE’s four purchased hydroelectric generating plants. This control center coordinates the operation of several hydroelectric generating plants for the plant owners and purchasers.

The individual units of the remaining seven of PGE’s wholly owned and three non-PURPA hydroelectric generating plants are typically block loaded subject to river flow, reservoir elevation, unit availability, license constraints and the regional coordination of hydroelectric plant operation.

PGE also block loads the individual units of its thermal generating plants subject to unit availability and energy market conditions. Since block load operation is considered the most efficient mode of operation for these plants they do not receive an automatic generation control (AGC) signal. The block loading of these thermal generating plants depends upon a number of factors including: the cost and availability of fuel, the availability of PGE’s and regional hydroelectric generating plants, the energy market and the terms of the joint operating agreements. 

System Lambda

PGE does not calculate a system lambda because demand following is not performed by thermal generating units.

The Economic Dispatch (ED) function establishes the optimum basepoints for the in-service economically dispatchable thermal generating units in a manner than minimizes the total system production cost, considering the effects of transmission losses, while respecting unit economic and response rate limits.

Significant Features and Benefits

Event triggered ED executions, following relevant changes in power system or generating unit conditions, ensure the timely calculation of optimum basepoints.  Economic participation factors, representing a linear approximation of the ED function, allow adjustment of optimum basepoints to compensate for minor system load changes occurring between ED executions.

The emission constraints of the 1990 Clean Air act can be included in the Economic Dispatch function as an option.

A dual dispatch approach advises the operator of optimum basepoints for selected manually controlled units as well as for automatically controlled units.

Actual and ideal production cost differences reveal system regulation costs and the cost of manually controlled unit operation at nonoptimum basepoints.

Use of real-time penalty factors, derived by security analysis functions (if provided), to account for transmission losses provides the most accurate analysis, ensuring the maximum possible fuel savings.

B-matrix and constant coefficient penalty factor calculation methods account for transmission losses when real-time penalty factors are not available.

Multiple fuel cost and heat rate curve data sets allow modeling of different fuel types and operating conditions for each generating unit.

Technical Overview

Activation Mechanism

The real-time ED function calculates optimum basepoints for the dispatchable thermal generating units on a periodic, operator demand, or event triggered basis.  ED executes periodically when a tunable maximum time period between basepoint calculations, typically five-minutes, has elapsed.  The operator may request execution of the ED function via the CRT displays.  To ensure the most economical system operation, ED also executes as a result of the following events.

The control area load changes significantly since the last basepoint calculation

The control area net interchange changes significantly since the last basepoint calculation

The dispatch status of a generating unit changes

The Automatic Generation Control function, using economic participation factors, adjusts the economic basepoint of a dispatchable generating unit to an economic limit

The operator modifies generating unit fuel cost or heat rate curve data

A tunable minimum time period between basepoint calculations prevents excessive event triggered ED executions.

Economic Basepoint Calculations

ED obtains the most economic system operation when the incremental cost of power delivered to the load is the same for all dispatchable generating units.  Calculation of the unit economic basepoints involves the solution of a set of coordination equations of the following form via a Lagrangian method:

	FCOSTi * dli/dPi;=LAMBDA/PFi

Subject to the constraint equation:

	   n
	?P?= DISPGEN
	   1

where:

	LAMBDA	=  	system incremental cost ($/MW.h)
	FCOSTi	=  	fuel cost for unit ?($/MMBTU)
	dl?/dP?	=  	incremental heat rate for unit i (MMBTU/MW.h)
	PF?        	=  	penalty factor for unit ?
	P?  	=  	economic basepoint for unit ?(MW)
	n  	=  	number of generating units dispatched
	DISPGEN 	= 		total dispatched generation (MW)

A variable number of straight line segments, defined by monotonically increasing ordinates and abscissas, approximate the generating unit incremental heat rate curves.  Multiple fuel cost and incremental heat rate curve data sets, typically six for each generating unit, permit modeling of different fuel types and/or unit operating conditions.  CRT displays allow operator selection of the fuel cost and incremental heat rate curve data set most applicable to the current conditions.  On-line modification for fuel cost and heat rate data allow modeling of current unit conditions.

A study mode dispatch calculates economic basepoints for selected manually controlled units as well as for automatically controlled units.  For the most economic system operation, generating units should operate at basepoints determined from dispatch considering units operating in the AUTOMATIC, ECONOMIC, and MANUAL-DISPATCH control modes.  The results of this dispatch consist of economic basepoints, presented on CRT displays that serve only as operator recommendations.  In this dispatch, unit high and low economic limits constrain the basepoint calculation.

Economic Participation Factors

To accurately reflect actual system economics, the AGC function requires basepoints from a real-time dispatch considering only units operating in the AUTOMATIC and ECONOMIC control mode.  The results of this dispatch consist of economic basepoints and economic participation factors that are input to the AGC desired generation calculation.  The economic participation factors, a linear representation of the incremental cost function for each generating unit operating in the AUTOMATIC control mode, allow adjustment of the economic basepoints to compensate for the minor system load changes that occur between ED executions.

Their use reduces the ED function execution frequency without sacrificing economic operation.  In this dispatch, unit response rate limits as well as high and low economic limits constrain the basepoint calculation.

Penalty Factors

Penalty factors adjust the incremental cost for each generating unit to account for transmission losses incurred due to an incremental change in generation.  The ED function supports three penalty factor calculation methods, real-time, B-Matrix and constant coefficient.  The operator may select, via CRT display, the penalty factor calculation method to be used.

The Penalty Factor Calculation function derives real-time penalty factors using the Jacobian algorithm based on the current power system configuration and condition, as determined by the State Estimation function.  A CRT display presents the real-time penalty factors for each generating unit.

Penalty factors derived from B-matrix and constant coefficient methods account for transmission losses incurred in a specific power system configuration and condition.  The B-matrix penalty factor for a given generating unit is dependent on injections at prespecified power system busses, generally, where generating units, tie-lines and nonconforming loads are connected.  The constant coefficient penalty factor for a given generating unit is linearly proportional to the total system generation.  To provide more accurate assessments using these techniques, ED automatically selects from several sets of B-matrix and constant coefficient data, representing different power system configurations and conditions, based on the system load level.




Emission Dispatch (Option)

The Clean Air Act of 1990 defines a two phased reduction in the emissions of electric generation plants.  From 1995 to 2000, Phase I limits the SO2 emissions of pre-selected generating units.  Phase II becomes effective after the year 2000 and restricts SO2 and NOx emissions for all units over 25 MW.

The emission dispatch calculates generating unit basepoints that minimize the company production cost as well as constraint emissions to hourly emission limits determined by long range planning studies.

Initially, ED performs a dispatch based on generating unit fuel costs and heat rate characteristics.  The pertinent results of this minimum cost dispatch include unit basepoints, system production cost rate and system NOx and SO2 emission rate.  System production cost and emission rates are a summation of individual unit production cost and emission rates, calculated by integration of the incremental heat and emission rate curves to the unit basepoint.

ED performs a second dispatch based on generating unit fuel costs and composite heat and emission rate characteristics.  The composite heat and emission rate characteristics result from a summation of incremental cost curve breakpoints and cost-weighted incremental emission curve breakpoints.  The pertinent results of this dispatch include unit basepoints and system production cost rate and emission rates.

From the results of the two dispatches, ED calculates and emission improvement cost, i.e., the ratio of the increase in production cost to the decrease in emission.  If the emission improvement cost exceeds an operator specified maximum limit, indicating that a reduction in emission is not cost effective, the dispatch solution is complete even if the system emission rates exceed the emission rate limits.  This situation constitutes a recommendation to purchase emission improvement cost is less than an operator specified minimum limit, indicating that a small increase in fuel costs results in significant emission resolutions, ED increases the emission cost weighing factor and the solution continues.

ED compares the system emission rates with NO and SO2 emission rate limits derived from the hourly emission allowances calculated by long term planning functions.  The derived NOx and SO2 emission rate limits consider actual accumulated emissions and expected generation requirement changes.  If the system emission rate exceeds an emission rate limit, ED increases the corresponding emission cost weighing factor and performs another dispatch.  ED repeats the solution process until the system NOx and SO2 emission rates meet the emission rate limits or the emission improvement cost exceeds its limit.

The results of the emission dispatch include the following quantities:

Cost of compliance with emission limits
Optimum generating unit basepoints and participation factors
Expected hourly and instantaneous generating unit and total company emissions (SO2, NOx)
Hourly and instantaneous generating unit and total company fuel usage

Omaha Public Power District (OPPD) uses an Economic Dispatch algorithm to determine system lambda.  Only units, which are able to respond to load control (Automatic Generation Control, AGC), are included in the Economic Dispatch calculation.  Therefore, if a much more expensive unit is on-line, such as a combustion turbine, but is not available to respond to AGC, the cost of that unit is not reflected in the system lambda value.  If an inexpensive coal unit is on AGC at the same time a combustion turbine is on, but not on AGC, then the system lambda might be $8/MWH when the combustion turbine is costing $25/MWH or more.

Also, OPPD’s reported system lambda does not consider the costs of purchases or sales.  When OPPD has loaded its inexpensive coal generation, OPPD may choose to purchase energy, which is more expensive than coal but less expensive than operating a combustion turbine.  OPPD might back down some of its coal resources in order to meet operating reserves and load following obligations, and purchase a block of more expensive energy.  Under this scenario, reported system lambda would reflect the price of the coal generation on AGC, rather than the more expensive purchase.

SYSTEM LAMBDA DESCRIPTION



Given a system load, the Energy Management System (EMS) determines the 
most economical generation level for all units under economic dispatch control,
taking into account the units’ input-output characteristics, fuel costs, variable
maintenance costs, power losses over the transmission network, and emission
allowance costs.

A generating unit’s input-output characteristics relate fuel rate input (MBTU/HR)
to the unit’s power output (MW).  This is usually referred to as the heat rate 
curve.  The incremental heat rate curve, as the name implies, relates the 
incremental fuel rate input (MBTU/MWHR) to the unit’s power output (MW).
Multiplying by the composite fuel cost ($/MBTU), the unit’s incremental cost
curve - unit lambda - is obtained ($/MWHR vs. MW).  The curve is linearized
into seven segments.

The system incremental cost - system lambda - is developed from the individual
units with their associated power output constraints.  The optimal dispatch is
achieved when all available units operate at equal incremental cost.

267,2006,12,0,100,,"Control Area System Lambda

The TID Control Area Lambda is generally dictated by the market conditions.  TID supplies its load using Hydro, three gas plants, and purchases.  As is done in most places in the US, TID schedules its resources one day in advance.  TID’s thermal units are typically constrained by their minimum or maximum capabilities and / or the need to allow for the prudent amount of operating reserve.  In the hourly market, the schedulers adjust purchases or sales to account for changes in loads compared to the forecasted amount.  These transactions are often for amounts less than 10 MW.  During the hour, the generation levels at TID units are varied to meet the actual minute to minute variations in load.  In addition, the generation resources are adjusted to meet other operating criteria such as required water flows, required reserves, and environmental limitations at units.

More often than not, a significant change in load (A change that would be reflected in our forecasted load for the next clock hour) would result in a change in wholesale purchases or sales.  It would not result in a change in the operating level at our thermal units.  For this reason we have chosen to use the average of our purchase and sale prices that we saw for hourly transactions to report as our Lambda.  (We are not accounting for potential transmission costs that might be incurred.)  Those hours for which prices were not available or we neglected to record a price are marked as NA.

Upper Peninsula Power Company
Note:		System Dispatch  - Schedule VI


The Company’s service area is located in the central Upper Peninsula, which is largely rural and heavily wooded.  The Company’s loads are more concentrated in Marquette County, the Houghton-Keweenaw County area and Delta County, which are physically located in the Midwest ISO Footprint.  These three areas are connected by long transmission lines which are vulnerable to lightning, wind storms, heavy snowfall and other problems.  To assure reasonable reliability in these areas, The Midwest ISO dispatches generation in a manner that minimizes transmission line loading during storm periods.  

As a Market Participant in the MISO Market, UPPCO is required to submit maintenance schedules, and operational parameters and facility limitations prior to the operating day for UPPCO’s generation resources.  The generation resources committed by the MISO Market are guaranteed to receive their start-up, no-load, and dispatch minimum costs.  MISO employs a process to minimize the cost of dispatching the committed capacity.  MISO’s commitment and dispatch process settles as part of the Energy Market to ensure that sufficient generation resources are available and on-line to meet the demand and reserve requirements within the Market Footprint for each hour of the operating day.  During the operating day, the UPPCO operations group will respond to the unit commitment and dispatch directives that are provided from MISO.

UPPCO reviews its ability to purchase economic energy on a continuous basis and purchases capacity for its system as required to meet reserve requirements.

As a participant in the Market, UPPCO is able to offer in each of its generating units on a bid basis and, if accepted, receives the Locational Marginal Price (“LMP”) at each location for the power supplied to the market.  At the same time UPPCO also purchases from the market all power required to meet its load obligations and pays LMP at its load zone. The LMP price paid to generators, and paid by Load Serving Entities (“LSE”), is based on the highest cost bid into the Market that is accepted by the MISO for each hour.  This process assures that the lowest priced generators within the MISO Market are operating at each hour, that generators are paid a reasonable market price and that the LSEs pay a market price that reflects marginal power costs, marginal congestion and marginal loss costs.

CWLP

Description of Economic Dispatch Also, provide in writing a detailed description of how Respondent calculates system lambda.  For those systems that do not use an economic dispatch algorithm and do not have a system lambda, provide in writing a detailed description of how control area resources are efficiently dispatched.


The CWLP system lambda is based on a system incremental heat rate calculated from the Energy Management System (EMS).  The EMS only includes units that are on control in calculating the system lambda.  The incremental system heat rate (mmBtu/MWH) is multiplied by the fuel cost ($/mmBTU) to arrive at the system lambda ($/MWH).   When a less efficient unit or more expensive unit, is on-line the system lambda calculated by the EMS is replaced by the lambda of the more espensive unit. Variable Operation & Maintenance (O&M) costs and transmission losses are not included in the system lambda calculations. 

CWLP participates in the Midwest ISO (MISO) energy market.  CWLP’s generators follow the dispatch base point signals received from the MISO every five minutes.  The units in the MISO energy market are dispatched based on price offer curves provided by market participants.  MISO dispatches units according to the Security Constrained Economic Dispatch (SCED).  MISO uses SCED to dispatch units in a manner that tries to minimize the overall cost of energy, based on the Locational Marginal Price (LMP).  The LMP includes the incremental energy offer of the most expensive unit used to serve the load and the cost of congestion and losses at every Commercial Pricing Point Node (CPn) in the system.  MISO also uses the Reliability Assessment Commitment (RAC) process to dispatch units for reliability in the bulk electric system which may override the SCED dispatch solution.

116,2006,12,0,100,,"5.5  Economic Allocation - Lambda Dispatch

The Lambda algorithm function determines generator base points and allocates additional reserve to determine new dispatch limits prior to the final base point calculation.

The classical Lambda algorithm solution technique is employed along with additional features that are described below.  The algorithm solution provides a set of generation levels and inverse slopes of the incremental cost curve.  The slope values are later applied for the determination of economic participation factors.

The following notation is used:

P			-	generation MW for a unit being dispatched
Sum p	-	Sum of individual p values being dispatched
DMW	-	total dispatch MW
c			-	generator unit cost curve; c(p) = cost at p output
L			-	Lagrange multiplier whose solution value will be the solution Lambda 

5.5.1  Classical Iterative Approach

The objective of the Lambda algorithm is to find a set of generation p values at minimum total cost for a given desired MW value, DMW:

DMW = SUM p

Since the total cost function is the sum of individual (non-linear) cost functions, the classical Lagrange multiplier method minimizes the augmented cost function F:

F = Sum c(p) + L * (Sum p - PD - TL)

subject to:

MNDP £ p £MXDP

where:	c						-	cost function of generation p
L						-	Lambda (Lagrange multiplier)
PD					-	total system load or demand; constant
TL					-	total transmission losses which is a function of p
MXDP,MNDP	-	given dispatch limits

For the solution set of p values, the term (Sum p - PD - TL) is zero and F will be the minimum total cost.

The minimum of F is determined when each first derivative of F with respect to generator i, df/dp(i), is zero.  The solution criterion is met by the simultaneous solution of the following coordination equations:

(dC(1)/dP(1)) * PF(1) = L
(dC(2)/dP(2)) * PF(2) = L
 .
 .
 .
(dC(n)/dP(n)) * PF(n) = L

where:	dC(i)/dP(i)	-	dc/dp, incremental cost c of unit i at generation level P
PF(i)			-	1/(1 - dTL/dP(i))
-	penalty factor as function of the incremental transmission loss for generator i, dTL/dP(i)
L					-	incremental cost at delivered power, Lambda

These equations state that the incremental cost of delivered power is equal for all dispatched resources.  The penalty factor takes into account the cost of transferring the generated power to the load center.  The penalty factors are assembled by the ED data processing function from one of four sets of penalty factors and entered dispatch (multiplier) factors found in the database.

The MW output of each generator is obtained from its incremental cost curve for the iteration lambda.  If the MW value is outside of the unit dispatch limits, the output is held at the appropriate limit.

5.5.2  Additional Features

Additional features enhance the classical Lambda dispatch algorithm.  These features are:

·	fixing and removing resources from iterations

·	Lambda postulate algorithm

The fixing and removing of units from further iterations is performed when the previous iteration does not converge to the solution.  This process consists of recognizing the over- or under-generating state of the previous iteration pass.  At this point, the units are fixed at their high limits in the under-generating state and removed from the iterative loop, since their dispatch levels would not change in further iterations.  Units are fixed at their low limits in the over-generating state in a similar fashion.

In the Lambda algorithm, the composite slope at the previous lambda from units remaining in the iteration loop is applied as part of the first-order Taylor's approximation of lambda:

L(new) = L(prev) + m' * MWERROR

subject to dynamic high and low lambda limits LMAX and LMIN:

LMIN £ L(new) £ LMAX

where:	m'				-	slope of the composite incremental cost curve
L( )				-	lambda postulate
MWERROR	-	the excess of (over-generation) or lack of (under-generation) dispatch MW's
LMAX		-	L(prev) when L(new) will be smaller
LMIN			-	L(prev) when L(new) will be larger
By constraining L within LMAX and LMIN, a diverging solution is prevented.  If the new L fails the limit test, it is not set to the limit but rather is recomputed by bisection:

L(new) = (LMAX + LMIN)/2

5.5.3  Coordination Equations Solution

The solution of the coordination equations proceeds in an iterative fashion.  The major steps in the solution include:

·	postulation of solution lambda L

·	derivation of unit dispatch MW from the ICC for all units

·	decision as to the necessity for another iteration (by comparing total dispatched MW to total desired MW)

·	fixing and removing resources prior to next iteration

Solution lambda L is initialized by observing resource limits.  The incremental cost LMIN associated with the cheapest resource at its minimum limit and the incremental cost LMAX associated with the most expensive resource at its maximum limit are used in the initial guess of L.  When the previous solution is within these limits, its value is used as L(0); otherwise L(0) is computed by bisection as follows:

L(0) = (LMAX + LMIN)/2

Postulation of lambda between iterations utilizes the slope of the composite incremental cost curve at the current guess of lambda:

L(new) = L(prev) + (DMW-Sum p)/INVSLP

where:	L(new)	-	new guess of lambda
L(prev)	-	previous iteration guess of lambda
INVSLP	-	inverse slope of the composite cost curve at L(prev)
= sum (inverse(unit ICC slopes))
DMW		-	total desired dispatch MW
Sum p		-	sum of base points at previous iteration

Resources are dispatched at the current guess for solution lambda.  Each dispatched MW level is constrained by the unit dispatch limits; when the dispatch level is beyond a limit, it is set to that limit.

Upon comparison of DMW and the sum of base points, it can be determined if the current guess of lambda results in too much generation or too little generation.  In certain situations, units can be removed from further calculations.  This technique improves the performance of the solution.  The positive slope characteristic of the unit ICC's allows this assumption.

The following outline illustrates the solution procedure:

-	Else, set the inverse icc slope value
4.3.3	If under-generating state,

CWLP

Description of Economic Dispatch Also, provide in writing a detailed description of how Respondent calculates system lambda.  For those systems that do not use an economic dispatch algorithm and do not have a system lambda, provide in writing a detailed description of how control area resources are efficiently dispatched.


The CWLP system lambda is based on a system incremental heat rate calculated from the Energy Management System (EMS).  The EMS only includes units that are on control in calculating the system lambda.  The incremental system heat rate (mmBtu/MWH) is multiplied by the fuel cost ($/mmBTU) to arrive at the system lambda ($/MWH).   When a less efficient unit or more expensive unit, is on-line the system lambda calculated by the EMS is replaced by the lambda of the more espensive unit. Variable Operation & Maintenance (O&M) costs and transmission losses are not included in the system lambda calculations. 

CWLP participates in the Midwest ISO (MISO) energy market.  CWLP’s generators follow the dispatch base point signals received from the MISO every five minutes.  The units in the MISO energy market are dispatched based on price offer curves provided by market participants.  MISO dispatches units according to the Security Constrained Economic Dispatch (SCED).  MISO uses SCED to dispatch units in a manner that tries to minimize the overall cost of energy, based on the Locational Marginal Price (LMP).  The LMP includes the incremental energy offer of the most expensive unit used to serve the load and the cost of congestion and losses at every Commercial Pricing Point Node (CPn) in the system.  MISO also uses the Reliability Assessment Commitment (RAC) process to dispatch units for reliability in the bulk electric system which may override the SCED dispatch solution.

116,2007,12,0,100,,"5.5  Economic Allocation - Lambda Dispatch

The Lambda algorithm function determines generator base points and allocates additional reserve to determine new dispatch limits prior to the final base point calculation.

The classical Lambda algorithm solution technique is employed along with additional features that are described below.  The algorithm solution provides a set of generation levels and inverse slopes of the incremental cost curve.  The slope values are later applied for the determination of economic participation factors.

The following notation is used:

P			-	generation MW for a unit being dispatched
Sum p	-	Sum of individual p values being dispatched
DMW	-	total dispatch MW
c			-	generator unit cost curve; c(p) = cost at p output
L			-	Lagrange multiplier whose solution value will be the solution Lambda 

5.5.1  Classical Iterative Approach

The objective of the Lambda algorithm is to find a set of generation p values at minimum total cost for a given desired MW value, DMW:

DMW = SUM p

Since the total cost function is the sum of individual (non-linear) cost functions, the classical Lagrange multiplier method minimizes the augmented cost function F:

F = Sum c(p) + L * (Sum p - PD - TL)

subject to:

MNDP £ p £MXDP

where:	c						-	cost function of generation p
L						-	Lambda (Lagrange multiplier)
PD					-	total system load or demand; constant
TL					-	total transmission losses which is a function of p
MXDP,MNDP	-	given dispatch limits

For the solution set of p values, the term (Sum p - PD - TL) is zero and F will be the minimum total cost.

The minimum of F is determined when each first derivative of F with respect to generator i, df/dp(i), is zero.  The solution criterion is met by the simultaneous solution of the following coordination equations:

(dC(1)/dP(1)) * PF(1) = L
(dC(2)/dP(2)) * PF(2) = L
 .
 .
 .
(dC(n)/dP(n)) * PF(n) = L

where:	dC(i)/dP(i)	-	dc/dp, incremental cost c of unit i at generation level P
PF(i)			-	1/(1 - dTL/dP(i))
-	penalty factor as function of the incremental transmission loss for generator i, dTL/dP(i)
L					-	incremental cost at delivered power, Lambda

These equations state that the incremental cost of delivered power is equal for all dispatched resources.  The penalty factor takes into account the cost of transferring the generated power to the load center.  The penalty factors are assembled by the ED data processing function from one of four sets of penalty factors and entered dispatch (multiplier) factors found in the database.

The MW output of each generator is obtained from its incremental cost curve for the iteration lambda.  If the MW value is outside of the unit dispatch limits, the output is held at the appropriate limit.

5.5.2  Additional Features

Additional features enhance the classical Lambda dispatch algorithm.  These features are:

·	fixing and removing resources from iterations

·	Lambda postulate algorithm

The fixing and removing of units from further iterations is performed when the previous iteration does not converge to the solution.  This process consists of recognizing the over- or under-generating state of the previous iteration pass.  At this point, the units are fixed at their high limits in the under-generating state and removed from the iterative loop, since their dispatch levels would not change in further iterations.  Units are fixed at their low limits in the over-generating state in a similar fashion.

In the Lambda algorithm, the composite slope at the previous lambda from units remaining in the iteration loop is applied as part of the first-order Taylor's approximation of lambda:

L(new) = L(prev) + m' * MWERROR

subject to dynamic high and low lambda limits LMAX and LMIN:

LMIN £ L(new) £ LMAX

where:	m'				-	slope of the composite incremental cost curve
L( )				-	lambda postulate
MWERROR	-	the excess of (over-generation) or lack of (under-generation) dispatch MW's
LMAX		-	L(prev) when L(new) will be smaller
LMIN			-	L(prev) when L(new) will be larger
By constraining L within LMAX and LMIN, a diverging solution is prevented.  If the new L fails the limit test, it is not set to the limit but rather is recomputed by bisection:

L(new) = (LMAX + LMIN)/2

5.5.3  Coordination Equations Solution

The solution of the coordination equations proceeds in an iterative fashion.  The major steps in the solution include:

·	postulation of solution lambda L

·	derivation of unit dispatch MW from the ICC for all units

·	decision as to the necessity for another iteration (by comparing total dispatched MW to total desired MW)

·	fixing and removing resources prior to next iteration

Solution lambda L is initialized by observing resource limits.  The incremental cost LMIN associated with the cheapest resource at its minimum limit and the incremental cost LMAX associated with the most expensive resource at its maximum limit are used in the initial guess of L.  When the previous solution is within these limits, its value is used as L(0); otherwise L(0) is computed by bisection as follows:

L(0) = (LMAX + LMIN)/2

Postulation of lambda between iterations utilizes the slope of the composite incremental cost curve at the current guess of lambda:

L(new) = L(prev) + (DMW-Sum p)/INVSLP

where:	L(new)	-	new guess of lambda
L(prev)	-	previous iteration guess of lambda
INVSLP	-	inverse slope of the composite cost curve at L(prev)
= sum (inverse(unit ICC slopes))
DMW		-	total desired dispatch MW
Sum p		-	sum of base points at previous iteration

Resources are dispatched at the current guess for solution lambda.  Each dispatched MW level is constrained by the unit dispatch limits; when the dispatch level is beyond a limit, it is set to that limit.


Upon comparison of DMW and the sum of base points, it can be determined if the current guess of lambda results in too much generation or too little generation.  In certain situations, units can be removed from further calculations.  This technique improves the performance of the solution.  The positive slope characteristic of the unit ICC's allows this assumption.

The following outline illustrates the solution procedure:

1.0	Initialization
1.1	Make initial guess for solution lambda; determine LMAX and LMIN
1.1.1	If old solution outside (LMIN<LMAX), then set L(0) = (LMAX + LMIN)/2

1.2	Initialize values to zero

2.1.1	Compute ICC ordinate, L(i) / (unit penalty factor)
2.1.2	Find corresponding MW output from the unit's ICC using interpolation or extrapolation
2.1.3	If unit CDP > MXDP, set CDP = MXDP
2.1.4	If unit CDP < MNDP, set CDP = MNDP

2.2	Accumulate total generation, G(i) = G(i) + unit CDP

3.0	Determine if solution has converged
3.1	If the magnitude of (G(i) - DMW) £ tolerance,
3.1.1	Set convergent solution indicator and exit via section 5.0

4.0	Prepare for next iteration
4.1	Increment iteration counter, i = i + 1
4.1.1	If i > max, set nonconvergent solution indicator and exit via section 5.0

4.2	Modify lambda limits
4.2.1	If over-generating (G(i-1) > DMW), set LMAX = L(prev)
4.2.2	If under-generating (G(i-1) < DMW), set LMIN = L(prev)

4.3	Establish loop for all dispatched units to determine feasibility
4.3.1	Set INVSLP = 0 and CMW = 0, where CMW is the total of unit CDP values
4.3.2	If over-generating state,
-	If unit is dispatched at its minimum dispatch limit, remove the unit from dispatch
-	Else, set the inverse icc slope value
4.3.3	If under-generating state,
-	If unit is dispatched at its maximum dispatch limit, remove the unit from dispatch

				Economic Dispatch with Multiple Fuel Prices

1.0  Function Description

	The proposed Economic Dispatch software enhancement is designed to provide the capability for Chugach to 
	economically dispatch their generation subject to these additional constraints:

	When gas flow at Beluga exceeds a specified amount, all additional gas is provided at a different price from 
	the base load gas.

	Dispatch power for incremental sales to GVEA on top of Chugach generation at a different price from the 
	Chugach fuel price.

2.0 Implementation

	The new Economic Dispatch uses the existing algorithm, as described in the attached appendix, to perform the 
	basic dispatch.  However, the overall econimic dispatch is now performed in three passes.  These three passes are 
	designated Base dispatch, Secondary dispatch and GVEA dispatch.  The sequence of calculation is given below:
			
					Base Dispatch

		 - Set load to actual load less the GVEA load.  Use actual unit limits and the base fuel price.

		 - Dispatch the generation to meet the load.


					Secondary Dispatch

	If Beluga gas exceeds the base gas consumption limit:
	
	 - Dispatch to the base gas limit

	 - Set the low limits to the dispatched unit outputs.  Use the secondary fuel prices.

	 - Dispatch the generation to meet the load. 

					GVEA Dispatch

	 - Set load to actual load, including the GVEA load.  Set the low limits to the dispatched unit outputs. Use 
	    the GVEA fuel prices.

	 - Dispatch the generation to meet the load.

		

					Appendix A
					Method of Calculation

The coordination equations to be solved by EDC are:

(CJ* df/dpj +Imj) * PFj = Lambda

Where 	Cj		 = Fuel Cost for the jth unit.

	dfj/jpj		 = Incremental heat rate for the jth unit.

	IMj		 = Incremental maintenance cost for the jth unit

	PFj		 = Penalty Factor for the jth unit.
			    Used to bias entire unit cost

	LAMBDA		 = Incremental cost of supplying power to a hypothetical load center of the
			     area.

In addition to the coordination equations, the following power balance equation must be satisfied:

SUM OF Basepoints of 
               dispatched		 = SUM OF		Actual generation of dispatched 
              generation 				units (at beginning of dispatch)
              ( at end of dispatch)

			+SUM of		rate-limited difference between
					base points and current generation
					of units on ramp, base load, or base
					load and regulating

			+DG

Where: DG is normally FACE but is limited to the maximum MW all units on control may move
 during the interval between EDC executions.  DG always has the same sign as FACE.

	The EDC routine consists of an inner and outer loop.  The inner loop is a binary search routine for solving the 
coordination equations in order to obtain base points for a fixed value of LAMBDA.

	During this solution it is necessary, of course, to recognize the high and low exonomic limits and the 
calculated high and low rate limits.  Once the base points have been determined an outer loop calculation is made to see 
if the power balance equation is satisfied.  If not, LAMBDA is adjusted, the inner loop is then reentered and a new set 
of base points calculated.

	This proceedure will continue until one of these conditions is met:

	1.  Both the coordination equations and the power balance equation are satisfied to within 
	     specified tolerances.

	2.  Either the coordination equations or the power balance equation does not converse because of 
	      numerical or physical problems.  In this case a message is sent to the system console.

	Assuming that a valid solution is obtained, the economic participation factors are computed for those units, 
which are to follow load.  The base points and economic participation factors (for the load following units) are then 
updated for use by the AGC routines.  The econmic participation factors for the units which are not load following are 
set to zero.

	Economic participation factors are calculated by assuming that the slope of the LAMBDA versus generation 
curve is constant over a short range.  The load is increased by a percentage, DELEDC, and a new dispatch is made.  
Economic participation factors for load above the sum of base points are then calculated:

	UEPDFUPj = (change in unitj generation)/
		  (change in system load)

	The load is then decreased to the same percentage below its original value, and a new dispatch is made.  
Econimic participation factors for load below the sum of base points are calculated in the same way as the increasing ones.

	EDC utilized the Auto-Ranging Binary Search method.  It operates by dividing the search region into two, 
 deciding which half the desired result is in, dividing that half into two, and so on until a solution is obtained. Starting 
with the desired generation DESGEN (=sum of all generation from telemetry + FACE) and an initial value of 
LAMBDA ( usually the value from the last EDC), the calculation proceeds until the error (MWn-DESGEN)  is less than
 a set fraction of DESGEN.  This fraction, ERRTPW, resides in the database.

	The binary search algorithm will always work for the Economic Dispatch Calculation when given a realistic 
set of conditions. Discontinous heat rate curve is also supported.  Discontinous curves have slopes that are infinite at 
certain points. 	",0

	MINCAP = Minimum capacity limit of the unit (MW)
	UIHRi = Incremental Heat Rate curve of unit i

	UFMCi = Fixed maintenance cost ($/H) of unit i

Plant production costs are calculated as the sum of the unit production costs in each plant.  System production costs are calculated as the sum of the unit production costs for all units.

Unit fuel consumption is calculated as follows:

 

Where

	UFCOi = Fuel consumption (MBtu/H) of unit i

157,2007,12,0,100,,"Duke’s approach to economic dispatch involves the iterative process of evaluating system incremental costs, unit generation levels, and system load requirements.  The theory behind economic dispatch is to operate the generation units at an equal incremental cost (adjusted for transmission losses) to minimize system costs.  The process is conceptually described as follows:
Select a system incremental cost to evaluate based on system load requirements.
Use the selected system incremental cost to calculate unit incremental costs using unit penalty factors.  Unit penalty factors relate unit generation levels to system transmission losses.
Calculate unit generation levels using the unit incremental cost and unit incremental cost curves.
Sum up unit generation levels to get system generation.
Compare system generation to system load requirements.
If system generation is less than system load requirements, select a new system incremental cost that is greater than the previous system incremental cost.  If system generation is greater than system load requirement, select a new system incremental cost that is less than the previous system incremental cost.
Return to step 2 and continue the process.

Once system generation equals the system load requirements (within a small deadband), the economic dispatch process is complete.  The last system incremental cost is system lambda, and the last unit generation levels are the optimal generation levels.

PGE does not use an economic dispatch algorithm for demand following. PGE’s control area uses hydroelectric generating units for demand following. The following describes PGE’s 2007 control area resources and how it dispatches them to meet its control area demand.

PGE’s Resources

PGE control area resources include: eight wholly owned hydroelectric generating plants, the purchase of the output of four hydroelectric generating plants, two jointly owned coal-fired generating plants, two wholly owned combined cycle combustion turbine plants, one PURPA contract thermal generating plant, one PURPA contract hydroelectric generating plant, three non-PURPA contract hydroelectric generating plants and one non-utility thermal generating plant.

Dispatch of PGE’s Resources

Demand following is accomplished by sending the AGC signal either directly to the one of the units of PGE’s Round Butte hydroelectric generating plant or to the control center which coordinates the operation of PGE’s four purchased hydroelectric generating plants. This control center coordinates the operation of several hydroelectric generating plants for the plant owners and purchasers.

The individual units of the remaining seven of PGE’s wholly owned and three non-PURPA hydroelectric generating plants are typically block loaded subject to river flow, reservoir elevation, unit availability, license constraints and the regional coordination of hydroelectric plant operation.

PGE also block loads the individual units of its thermal generating plants subject to unit availability and energy market conditions. Since block load operation is considered the most efficient mode of operation for these plants they do not receive an automatic generation control (AGC) signal. The block loading of these thermal generating plants depends upon a number of factors including: the cost and availability of fuel, the availability of PGE’s and regional hydroelectric generating plants, the energy market and the terms of the joint operating agreements.

Part II - Schedule 6.  Control Area Hourly System Lambda



Description of Economic Dispatch

Calculation of System lambda

The goal of economic dispatch is to match electric power resources with electricity demand and thus make the Area Control Error (ACE) zero at the lowest total cost.  For a given system generation requirement, the cheapest operating point occurs where the incremental power cost (lambda) for each controllable unit are equal.  The mathematical derivation proving the merits of equal lambda dispatch may be found in most power system analysis text books.  The controller must therefore be able to find the right system lambda and the desired generation of each unit at that lambda.

Economic (equal lambda) dispatch at Progress Energy Carolinas is achieved with the use of unit incremental heat rate curves, fuel costs, emissions costs and penalty factors for transmission losses.  The incremental cost curve for each generating unit is the product of the incremental heat rate curve (that considers emissions per MBTU of heat input) multiplied by the unit fuel cost and adjusted by the penalty factor to account for transmission losses.  While attempting to maintain an ACE of zero, thus serving load commitments, each unit’s incremental cost curve is set equal to the system incremental cost (lambda) to determine unit output (MW).  As load increases and generation increases to achieve a zero ACE, a new system lambda is selected in order to match generation with load.  An iterative process of selecting lambda and determining unit output until ACE is brought to zero is employed constantly on the Energy Management System.  As load diminishes, generation is reduced to balance resources with demand to achieve a zero ACE.  Her again, a new system lambda is selected and unit incremental cost curves evaluated to match generation with load. ",0

multiplier and cast into a set of coordination equations. The fuel cost minimum value is found by the simultaneous
solution of these equations. The resulting value of the Lagrange multiplier is the system lambda.

The Economic Dispatch (ED) function establishes the optimum basepoints for the in-service economically dispatchable thermal generating units in a manner than minimizes the total system production cost, considering the effects of transmission losses, while respecting unit economic and response rate limits.

Significant Features and Benefits

Event triggered ED executions, following relevant changes in power system or generating unit conditions, ensure the timely calculation of optimum basepoints.  Economic participation factors, representing a linear approximation of the ED function, allow adjustment of optimum basepoints to compensate for minor system load changes occurring between ED executions.

The emission constraints of the 1990 Clean Air act can be included in the Economic Dispatch function as an option.

A dual dispatch approach advises the operator of optimum basepoints for selected manually controlled units as well as for automatically controlled units.

Actual and ideal production cost differences reveal system regulation costs and the cost of manually controlled unit operation at nonoptimum basepoints.

Use of real-time penalty factors, derived by security analysis functions (if provided), to account for transmission losses provides the most accurate analysis, ensuring the maximum possible fuel savings.

B-matrix and constant coefficient penalty factor calculation methods account for transmission losses when real-time penalty factors are not available.

Multiple fuel cost and heat rate curve data sets allow modeling of different fuel types and operating conditions for each generating unit.

Technical Overview

Activation Mechanism

The real-time ED function calculates optimum basepoints for the dispatchable thermal generating units on a periodic, operator demand, or event triggered basis.  ED executes periodically when a tunable maximum time period between basepoint calculations, typically five-minutes, has elapsed.  The operator may request execution of the ED function via the CRT displays.  To ensure the most economical system operation, ED also executes as a result of the following events.

The control area load changes significantly since the last basepoint calculation

The control area net interchange changes significantly since the last basepoint calculation

The dispatch status of a generating unit changes

The Automatic Generation Control function, using economic participation factors, adjusts the economic basepoint of a dispatchable generating unit to an economic limit

The operator modifies generating unit fuel cost or heat rate curve data

A tunable minimum time period between basepoint calculations prevents excessive event triggered ED executions.

Economic Basepoint Calculations

ED obtains the most economic system operation when the incremental cost of power delivered to the load is the same for all dispatchable generating units.  Calculation of the unit economic basepoints involves the solution of a set of coordination equations of the following form via a Lagrangian method:

	FCOSTi * dli/dPi;=LAMBDA/PFi

Subject to the constraint equation:

	   n
	?P?= DISPGEN
	   1

where:

	LAMBDA	=  	system incremental cost ($/MW.h)
	FCOSTi	=  	fuel cost for unit ?($/MMBTU)
	dl?/dP?	=  	incremental heat rate for unit i (MMBTU/MW.h)
	PF?        	=  	penalty factor for unit ?
	P?  	=  	economic basepoint for unit ?(MW)
	n  	=  	number of generating units dispatched
	DISPGEN 	= 		total dispatched generation (MW)

A variable number of straight line segments, defined by monotonically increasing ordinates and abscissas, approximate the generating unit incremental heat rate curves.  Multiple fuel cost and incremental heat rate curve data sets, typically six for each generating unit, permit modeling of different fuel types and/or unit operating conditions.  CRT displays allow operator selection of the fuel cost and incremental heat rate curve data set most applicable to the current conditions.  On-line modification for fuel cost and heat rate data allow modeling of current unit conditions.

A study mode dispatch calculates economic basepoints for selected manually controlled units as well as for automatically controlled units.  For the most economic system operation, generating units should operate at basepoints determined from dispatch considering units operating in the AUTOMATIC, ECONOMIC, and MANUAL-DISPATCH control modes.  The results of this dispatch consist of economic basepoints, presented on CRT displays that serve only as operator recommendations.  In this dispatch, unit high and low economic limits constrain the basepoint calculation.

Economic Participation Factors

To accurately reflect actual system economics, the AGC function requires basepoints from a real-time dispatch considering only units operating in the AUTOMATIC and ECONOMIC control mode.  The results of this dispatch consist of economic basepoints and economic participation factors that are input to the AGC desired generation calculation.  The economic participation factors, a linear representation of the incremental cost function for each generating unit operating in the AUTOMATIC control mode, allow adjustment of the economic basepoints to compensate for the minor system load changes that occur between ED executions.

Their use reduces the ED function execution frequency without sacrificing economic operation.  In this dispatch, unit response rate limits as well as high and low economic limits constrain the basepoint calculation.

Penalty Factors

Penalty factors adjust the incremental cost for each generating unit to account for transmission losses incurred due to an incremental change in generation.  The ED function supports three penalty factor calculation methods, real-time, B-Matrix and constant coefficient.  The operator may select, via CRT display, the penalty factor calculation method to be used.

The Penalty Factor Calculation function derives real-time penalty factors using the Jacobian algorithm based on the current power system configuration and condition, as determined by the State Estimation function.  A CRT display presents the real-time penalty factors for each generating unit.

Penalty factors derived from B-matrix and constant coefficient methods account for transmission losses incurred in a specific power system configuration and condition.  The B-matrix penalty factor for a given generating unit is dependent on injections at prespecified power system busses, generally, where generating units, tie-lines and nonconforming loads are connected.  The constant coefficient penalty factor for a given generating unit is linearly proportional to the total system generation.  To provide more accurate assessments using these techniques, ED automatically selects from several sets of B-matrix and constant coefficient data, representing different power system configurations and conditions, based on the system load level.




Emission Dispatch (Option)

The Clean Air Act of 1990 defines a two phased reduction in the emissions of electric generation plants.  From 1995 to 2000, Phase I limits the SO2 emissions of pre-selected generating units.  Phase II becomes effective after the year 2000 and restricts SO2 and NOx emissions for all units over 25 MW.

The emission dispatch calculates generating unit basepoints that minimize the company production cost as well as constraint emissions to hourly emission limits determined by long range planning studies.

Initially, ED performs a dispatch based on generating unit fuel costs and heat rate characteristics.  The pertinent results of this minimum cost dispatch include unit basepoints, system production cost rate and system NOx and SO2 emission rate.  System production cost and emission rates are a summation of individual unit production cost and emission rates, calculated by integration of the incremental heat and emission rate curves to the unit basepoint.

ED performs a second dispatch based on generating unit fuel costs and composite heat and emission rate characteristics.  The composite heat and emission rate characteristics result from a summation of incremental cost curve breakpoints and cost-weighted incremental emission curve breakpoints.  The pertinent results of this dispatch include unit basepoints and system production cost rate and emission rates.

From the results of the two dispatches, ED calculates and emission improvement cost, i.e., the ratio of the increase in production cost to the decrease in emission.  If the emission improvement cost exceeds an operator specified maximum limit, indicating that a reduction in emission is not cost effective, the dispatch solution is complete even if the system emission rates exceed the emission rate limits.  This situation constitutes a recommendation to purchase emission improvement cost is less than an operator specified minimum limit, indicating that a small increase in fuel costs results in significant emission resolutions, ED increases the emission cost weighing factor and the solution continues.

ED compares the system emission rates with NO and SO2 emission rate limits derived from the hourly emission allowances calculated by long term planning functions.  The derived NOx and SO2 emission rate limits consider actual accumulated emissions and expected generation requirement changes.  If the system emission rate exceeds an emission rate limit, ED increases the corresponding emission cost weighing factor and performs another dispatch.  ED repeats the solution process until the system NOx and SO2 emission rates meet the emission rate limits or the emission improvement cost exceeds its limit.

The results of the emission dispatch include the following quantities:

Cost of compliance with emission limits
Optimum generating unit basepoints and participation factors
Expected hourly and instantaneous generating unit and total company emissions (SO2, NOx)

DAM prices are determined on an hourly basis for each of the state's eleven zones and for the four neighboring areas (New England, Hydro Quebec, Ontario Hydro and PJM).  Typically more than 90% of energy transactions processed by NYISO occur in the DAM.  A software program called Security Constrained Unit Commitment (SCUC) determines the amount of energy expected to be needed within the state for each day.  NYISO will schedule the generating units that can most economically satisfy the energy needed to supply customers' demand and allow a sufficient reserve for contingencies.  The New York Marginal Cost of Energy is the base price that NYISO must pay to obtain the needed energy.  This base price is determined at the NYISO reference bus, so named because it is the reference against which losses, congestion, shift factors, penalty factors and othe system mathematical quantities are calculated.  It is physically located at the March 345 kV substation in Marcy, New York.  In transmitting energy across the state, there are additional costs for the electrical losses and sometimes for congestion when transmission lines become overloaded.

System lambda for the gas fired thermal units is calculated hourly, based on the input/output characteristics of the generating units on-line that day and the current natural gas market price including variable interstate and intrastate costs.

SYSTEM LAMBDA DESCRIPTION



Given a system load, the Energy Management System (EMS) determines the 
most economical generation level for all units under economic dispatch control,
taking into account the units’ input-output characteristics, fuel costs, variable
maintenance costs, power losses over the transmission network, and emission
allowance costs.

A generating unit’s input-output characteristics relate fuel rate input (MBTU/HR)
to the unit’s power output (MW).  This is usually referred to as the heat rate 
curve.  The incremental heat rate curve, as the name implies, relates the 
incremental fuel rate input (MBTU/MWHR) to the unit’s power output (MW).
Multiplying by the composite fuel cost ($/MBTU), the unit’s incremental cost
curve - unit lambda - is obtained ($/MWHR vs. MW).  The curve is linearized
into seven segments.

The system incremental cost - system lambda - is developed from the individual
units with their associated power output constraints.  The optimal dispatch is
achieved when all available units operate at equal incremental cost.

The Economic Dispatch function uses generator performance curves to allocate generation in the most economic manner for those units that are in the economic dispatch mode. As Seattle's generators and plants on the Skagit project are not hydraulically matched and there are seasonal flow constraints for fish protection, not all units can be operated in the economic dispatch mode. Seattle normally strives to fully utilize its hydro storage and peaking capability at both its Boundary and Skagit Projects. During the light load hours, we normally take a lower priced energy into our system, operate our Skagit Project to near minimum license requirements (fish flow minimum), and completely shut down our Boundary Project.

267,2007,12,0,100,,"Control Area System Lambda

The TID Control Area Lambda is generally dictated by the market conditions.  TID supplies its load using Hydro, three gas plants, and purchases.  As is done in most places in the US, TID schedules its resources one day in advance.  TID’s thermal units are typically constrained by their minimum or maximum capabilities and / or the need to allow for the prudent amount of operating reserve.  In the hourly market, the schedulers adjust purchases or sales to account for changes in loads compared to the forecasted amount.  These transactions are often for amounts less than 10 MW.  During the hour, the generation levels at TID units are varied to meet the actual minute to minute variations in load.  In addition, the generation resources are adjusted to meet other operating criteria such as required water flows, required reserves, and environmental limitations at units.

More often than not, a significant change in load (A change that would be reflected in our forecasted load for the next clock hour) would result in a change in wholesale purchases or sales.  It would not result in a change in the operating level at our thermal units.  For this reason we have chosen to use the average of our purchase and sale prices that we saw for hourly transactions to report as our Lambda.  (We are not accounting for potential transmission costs that might be incurred.)  Those hours for which prices were not available or we neglected to record a price are marked as zero.

ICi = IMCi + IHRi * FCi /EFi

Where: ICi = Incremental cost
IMCi = Incremental maintenance cost
IHRi = Incremental heat rate
FCi= Fuel cost
EFi= Efficiency factor

The next sub-function is the Dispatch Solution sub-function.  It calculates a lambda and economic base points for all units using the Generation Allocation sub-function.  The dispatch for each unit is constrained by the operational limits of the unit. A total system lambda is calculated from the total of the individual unit lambdas.

The Generation Allocation sub-function economically allocates the generation requirements for units.  The Generation To Be Dispatched (GTBD) is calculated as the sum of the previous base points plus the additional temporary generation (ACE plus Frequency Bias) provided from LFC.  The main algorithm uses a Minimization of System Production Cost equation.  The equations for the optimum megawatt dispatch are derived by the method of Lagrange multipliers.

Omaha Public Power District (OPPD) uses an Economic Dispatch algorithm to determine system lambda.  Only units, which are able to respond to load control (Automatic Generation Control, AGC), are included in the Economic Dispatch calculation.  Therefore, if a much more expensive unit is on-line, such as a combustion turbine, but is not available to respond to AGC, the cost of that unit is not reflected in the system lambda value.  If an inexpensive coal unit is on AGC at the same time a combustion turbine is on, but not on AGC, then the system lambda might be $8/MWH when the combustion turbine is costing $25/MWH or more.

Also, OPPD’s reported system lambda does not consider the costs of purchases or sales.  When OPPD has loaded its inexpensive coal generation, OPPD may choose to purchase energy, which is more expensive than coal but less expensive than operating a combustion turbine.  OPPD might back down some of its coal resources in order to meet operating reserves and load following obligations, and purchase a block of more expensive energy.  Under this scenario, reported system lambda would reflect the price of the coal generation on AGC, rather than the more expensive purchase.

Economic Dispatch Solution Module (EDSOL)
Given a system total generation requirement, EDSOL determines the most economical generation level for all generators under economic dispatch control, taking into account the generators inputoutput characteristics, the generators fuel costs and the power losses over the transmission network.
A generating unit's inputoutput characteristics relate the fuel rate input, MBTU/HR, to the generator's power output (MW). This is usually known as the heat rate curve. The incremental heat rate curve, as the name implies, relates the incremental fuel rate input, MBTU/MWHR, to the generator's power output. Multiplying by the generator's selected fuel's cost, $/MBTU, the generator's incremental cost curve is obtained ($/MWHR vs. MW). The generator's efficiency value (in percent) is also incorporated (by normalization and division) into the determination of the generator's incremental cost curve coefficients. The incremental heat rate curve is linearized and defined by up to eighteen straight- line segments. Each segment is defined by its two end points.
Mathematically, the economic dispatch problem can be expressed as the minimization of the generation cost, which is defined as:
	C = S ci (Pi)						(1)
Where
	C	=	generation cost
	Pi	=	output power of generator i
	ci (Pi)	=	fuel cost for Pi
Subject to the following constraints:
	Pmini =Pi  =Pmaxi					(2)
	S Pi = Load + Loss (P1. Pi, ...)			(3)
Where
	Pmini	=	minimum power of generator i
	Pmaxi	=	maximum power of generator i
	Load	=	system load
	Loss	=	line losses
Now, consider the augmented Lagrange cost function:
	£ = C -?( SPi - Load - Loss)				(4)
The optimal solution is given by:
	?£ = 0
	?Pi							(5)

i.e.,	?Ci (Pi)      -      ? (1 - ? Loss)   = 0
	  ? Pi                             ? Pi
Which gives the optimal coordination equations:
	?= Pfi    ?Ci (Pi)						(6)
                                       ?Pi
Where
	Pfi   =       1      		is the penalty factor of generator i.
                  1 - ? Loss
                       ? Pi
Equation (6) shows that the optimal dispatch is achieved when all generators operate at equal incremental cost ?.
Calculating the penalty factors Pfi, which are a measure of transmission losses, requires the solution of load flow equations.
The Economic Dispatch Solution routine's (EDSOL's) caller normally obtains the penalty factors from the database as calculated by Network Analysis. They can alternately be set by the user or set to unity (1.0).
Any Power Application that provides the appropriate set of input data can utilize EDSOL routine. The caller can optionally direct EDSOL to obtain certain input data, such as generators incremental heat rate curves coefficients and generators fuel selections and costs, directly from the appropriate database tables.
EDSOL begins its processing by adjusting the caller's total required generation to reflect the outputs available from off-control or from base loaded generators. The adjusted value is EDSOL's total required generation from among the economically dispatched generators. In the case of the Economic Dispatch Control (EDC) calling EDSOL, EDSOL develops its total required generation by summing the current actual MW outputs of the economically dispatched generators.
If EDSOL finds that its total required generation can not be satisfied due to being out of range of the EDC High or EDC Low limits sum, then each dispatched generator's desired generation value is set equal to the appropriate EDC limit before returning to the caller. EDSOL also returns the appropriate solution status indication, which the caller can check to detect and possibly act upon (such as by alerting the dispatcher or user) the situation.
EDSOL develops each dispatched generator's incremental cost curve coefficients, as described above, and determines the system's maximum and minimum possible values of Lambda as the initial bounds of the iterative Lambda search.
The set of simultaneous equations described above is solved iteratively by establishing a trial value of Lambda to calculate each dispatched generator's desired power output and the system sum of the desired power outputs. If the system sum of the desired power outputs matches (within a designated tolerance) EDSOL's total required generation, then the iterative Lambda search terminates. Otherwise, the trial value of Lambda is adjusted (using a binary search protected Newton's method adjustment) and another iteration's calculations are performed. The output of the terminated Lambda search is a tentative set of desired output values that are within the generators EDC High and EDC Low limits and will satisfy EDSOL's total required generation.
Each generator's tentative desired output is checked against the generator's designated and calculated disallowed regions. If one or more generator's tentative desired output is found to be within a disallowed region, then one such generator is selected to have its desired output subsequently clamped to the appropriate edge of the disallowed region. With that generator effectively removed from the solution calculations, EDSOL returns to again perform the iterative Lambda search among the reduced set of economically dispatched generators, and then again check for the need to move a generator's desired output value out of a disallowed region.
The disallowed regions check loop is terminated once EDSOL finds that no generator's desired output lies within a disallowed region.
If it is not possible to find a closely matching economic dispatch solution (the designated or calculated disallowed regions cause the economic dispatch solution problem to be excessively constrained), then EDSOL returns the appropriate solution status indication to the caller.
EDSOL returns to the caller the calculated value of Lambda and the set of desired outputs for the economically dispatched generators. Other data is also made available for the caller, such as the solution's status indication (Normal In Range Solution, Constrained By EDC High Limits Sum, etc.), a list of the indices of the economically dispatched generators and the set of calculated (pseudo) disallowed regions to be avoided to limit the starting or stopping of mills.

Dear Sir or Madam:

Our system lambda is calculated using the individual incremental heat rate curves for each unit and the fuel cost. The system Lambda data we have provided for 2007 includes data from January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2007. We have inserted “NA” in places where we do not have data due to system problems.

Economic Dispatch is an Automatic Generation Control (AGC) function used by ESCA EMS to determine the optimum loading of generating units in order to meet the system generation requirement. It takes into account unit operational constraints, incremental generation costs, incremental transmission losses, and reserve requirements,

A classical Lagrangian multiplier optimization algorithm is used to determine the loading of each dispatch-able unit to meet the net generation requirement while minimizing the overall system incremental costs. System Lambda is the cost to produce the next MW from this point. The System Lambda we are providing is calculated at the top of the clock hour.

The incremental costs curve (ICC) is calculated from its incremental heat rate curve, and fuel cost.

116,2008,12,0,100,,"5.5  Economic Allocation - Lambda Dispatch

The Lambda algorithm function determines generator base points and allocates additional reserve to determine new dispatch limits prior to the final base point calculation.

The classical Lambda algorithm solution technique is employed along with additional features that are described below.  The algorithm solution provides a set of generation levels and inverse slopes of the incremental cost curve.  The slope values are later applied for the determination of economic participation factors.

The following notation is used:

P			-	generation MW for a unit being dispatched
Sum p	-	Sum of individual p values being dispatched
DMW	-	total dispatch MW
c			-	generator unit cost curve; c(p) = cost at p output
L			-	Lagrange multiplier whose solution value will be the solution Lambda 

5.5.1  Classical Iterative Approach

The objective of the Lambda algorithm is to find a set of generation p values at minimum total cost for a given desired MW value, DMW:

DMW = SUM p

Since the total cost function is the sum of individual (non-linear) cost functions, the classical Lagrange multiplier method minimizes the augmented cost function F:

F = Sum c(p) + L * (Sum p - PD - TL)

subject to:

MNDP £ p £MXDP

where:	c						-	cost function of generation p
L						-	Lambda (Lagrange multiplier)
PD					-	total system load or demand; constant
TL					-	total transmission losses which is a function of p
MXDP,MNDP	-	given dispatch limits

For the solution set of p values, the term (Sum p - PD - TL) is zero and F will be the minimum total cost.

The minimum of F is determined when each first derivative of F with respect to generator i, df/dp(i), is zero.  The solution criterion is met by the simultaneous solution of the following coordination equations:

(dC(1)/dP(1)) * PF(1) = L
(dC(2)/dP(2)) * PF(2) = L
 .
 .
 .
(dC(n)/dP(n)) * PF(n) = L

where:	dC(i)/dP(i)	-	dc/dp, incremental cost c of unit i at generation level P
PF(i)			-	1/(1 - dTL/dP(i))
-	penalty factor as function of the incremental transmission loss for generator i, dTL/dP(i)
L					-	incremental cost at delivered power, Lambda

These equations state that the incremental cost of delivered power is equal for all dispatched resources.  The penalty factor takes into account the cost of transferring the generated power to the load center.  The penalty factors are assembled by the ED data processing function from one of four sets of penalty factors and entered dispatch (multiplier) factors found in the database.

The MW output of each generator is obtained from its incremental cost curve for the iteration lambda.  If the MW value is outside of the unit dispatch limits, the output is held at the appropriate limit.

5.5.2  Additional Features

Additional features enhance the classical Lambda dispatch algorithm.  These features are:

·	fixing and removing resources from iterations

·	Lambda postulate algorithm

The fixing and removing of units from further iterations is performed when the previous iteration does not converge to the solution.  This process consists of recognizing the over- or under-generating state of the previous iteration pass.  At this point, the units are fixed at their high limits in the under-generating state and removed from the iterative loop, since their dispatch levels would not change in further iterations.  Units are fixed at their low limits in the over-generating state in a similar fashion.

In the Lambda algorithm, the composite slope at the previous lambda from units remaining in the iteration loop is applied as part of the first-order Taylor's approximation of lambda:

L(new) = L(prev) + m' * MWERROR

subject to dynamic high and low lambda limits LMAX and LMIN:

LMIN £ L(new) £ LMAX

where:	m'				-	slope of the composite incremental cost curve
L( )				-	lambda postulate
MWERROR	-	the excess of (over-generation) or lack of (under-generation) dispatch MW's
LMAX		-	L(prev) when L(new) will be smaller
LMIN			-	L(prev) when L(new) will be larger
By constraining L within LMAX and LMIN, a diverging solution is prevented.  If the new L fails the limit test, it is not set to the limit but rather is recomputed by bisection:

L(new) = (LMAX + LMIN)/2

5.5.3  Coordination Equations Solution

The solution of the coordination equations proceeds in an iterative fashion.  The major steps in the solution include:

·	postulation of solution lambda L

·	derivation of unit dispatch MW from the ICC for all units

·	decision as to the necessity for another iteration (by comparing total dispatched MW to total desired MW)

·	fixing and removing resources prior to next iteration

Solution lambda L is initialized by observing resource limits.  The incremental cost LMIN associated with the cheapest resource at its minimum limit and the incremental cost LMAX associated with the most expensive resource at its maximum limit are used in the initial guess of L.  When the previous solution is within these limits, its value is used as L(0); otherwise L(0) is computed by bisection as follows:

L(0) = (LMAX + LMIN)/2

Postulation of lambda between iterations utilizes the slope of the composite incremental cost curve at the current guess of lambda:

L(new) = L(prev) + (DMW-Sum p)/INVSLP

where:	L(new)	-	new guess of lambda
L(prev)	-	previous iteration guess of lambda
INVSLP	-	inverse slope of the composite cost curve at L(prev)
= sum (inverse(unit ICC slopes))
DMW		-	total desired dispatch MW
Sum p		-	sum of base points at previous iteration

Resources are dispatched at the current guess for solution lambda.  Each dispatched MW level is constrained by the unit dispatch limits; when the dispatch level is beyond a limit, it is set to that limit.

Upon comparison of DMW and the sum of base points, it can be determined if the current guess of lambda results in too much generation or too little generation.  In certain situations, units can be removed from further calculations.  This technique improves the performance of the solution.  The positive slope characteristic of the unit ICC's allows this assumption.

The following outline illustrates the solution procedure:

The TID Balancing Authority Lambda is generally dictated by the market conditions.  TID supplies its load using hydro, three gas plants, and purchases.  As is done in most places in the U.S., TID schedules its resources one day in advance.  TID's thermal units are typically constrained by their minimum or maximum capabilities and/or the need to allow for the prudent amount of operating reserve.  In the hourly market, the schedulers adjust purchases or sales to account for changes in loads compared to the forecasted amount.  These transactions are often for amounts less than 10 MW.  During the hour, the generation levels at TID units are varied to meet the actual minute to minute variations in load.  In addition, the generation resources are adjusted to meet other operating criteria such as required water flows, required reserves, and environmental limitations at units.

More often than not, a significant change in load (a change that would be reflected in our forecasted load for the next clock hour) would result in a change in wholesale purchases or sales.  It would not result in a change in the operating level at our thermal units.  For this reason, we have chosen to use the average of our purchase and sale prices that we saw for hourly transactions to report as our Lambda.

Part II - Schedule 6.  Control Area System Lambda Data
Description of Economic Dispatch - System Lambda


Duke’s approach to economic dispatch involves the iterative process of evaluating system incremental costs, unit generation levels, and system load requirements.  The theory behind economic dispatch is to operate the generation units at an equal incremental cost (adjusted for transmission losses) to minimize system costs.  The process is conceptually described as follows:
Select a system incremental cost to evaluate based on system load requirements.
Use the selected system incremental cost to calculate unit incremental costs using unit penalty factors.  Unit penalty factors relate unit generation levels to system transmission losses.
Calculate unit generation levels using the unit incremental cost and unit incremental cost curves.
Sum up unit generation levels to get system generation.
Compare system generation to system load requirements.
If system generation is less than system load requirements, select a new system incremental cost that is greater than the previous system incremental cost.  If system generation is greater than system load requirement, select a new system incremental cost that is less than the previous system incremental cost.
Return to step 2 and continue the process.

Once system generation equals the system load requirements (within a small deadband), the economic dispatch process is complete.  The last system incremental cost is system lambda, and the last unit generation levels are the optimal generation levels.

The Economic Dispatch (ED) function establishes the optimum basepoints for the in-service economically dispatchable thermal generating units in a manner than minimizes the total system production cost, considering the effects of transmission losses, while respecting unit economic and response rate limits.

Significant Features and Benefits

Event triggered ED executions, following relevant changes in power system or generating unit conditions, ensure the timely calculation of optimum basepoints.  Economic participation factors, representing a linear approximation of the ED function, allow adjustment of optimum basepoints to compensate for minor system load changes occurring between ED executions.

The emission constraints of the 1990 Clean Air act can be included in the Economic Dispatch function as an option.

A dual dispatch approach advises the operator of optimum basepoints for selected manually controlled units as well as for automatically controlled units.

Actual and ideal production cost differences reveal system regulation costs and the cost of manually controlled unit operation at nonoptimum basepoints.

Use of real-time penalty factors, derived by security analysis functions (if provided), to account for transmission losses provides the most accurate analysis, ensuring the maximum possible fuel savings.

B-matrix and constant coefficient penalty factor calculation methods account for transmission losses when real-time penalty factors are not available.

Multiple fuel cost and heat rate curve data sets allow modeling of different fuel types and operating conditions for each generating unit.

Technical Overview

Activation Mechanism

The real-time ED function calculates optimum basepoints for the dispatchable thermal generating units on a periodic, operator demand, or event triggered basis.  ED executes periodically when a tunable maximum time period between basepoint calculations, typically five-minutes, has elapsed.  The operator may request execution of the ED function via the CRT displays.  To ensure the most economical system operation, ED also executes as a result of the following events.

The control area load changes significantly since the last basepoint calculation

The control area net interchange changes significantly since the last basepoint calculation

The dispatch status of a generating unit changes

The Automatic Generation Control function, using economic participation factors, adjusts the economic basepoint of a dispatchable generating unit to an economic limit

The operator modifies generating unit fuel cost or heat rate curve data

A tunable minimum time period between basepoint calculations prevents excessive event triggered ED executions.

ED obtains the most economic system operation when the incremental cost of power delivered to the load is the same for all dispatchable generating units.  Calculation of the unit economic basepoints involves the solution of a set of coordination equations of the following form via a Lagrangian method:

	FCOSTi * dli/dPi;=LAMBDA/PFi

Subject to the constraint equation:

	   n
	?P?= DISPGEN
	   1

where:

	LAMBDA	=  	system incremental cost ($/MW.h)
	FCOSTi	=  	fuel cost for unit ?($/MMBTU)
	dl?/dP?	=  	incremental heat rate for unit i (MMBTU/MW.h)
	PF?        	=  	penalty factor for unit ?
	P?  	=  	economic basepoint for unit ?(MW)
	n  	=  	number of generating units dispatched
	DISPGEN 	= 		total dispatched generation (MW)

A variable number of straight line segments, defined by monotonically increasing ordinates and abscissas, approximate the generating unit incremental heat rate curves.  Multiple fuel cost and incremental heat rate curve data sets, typically six for each generating unit, permit modeling of different fuel types and/or unit operating conditions.  CRT displays allow operator selection of the fuel cost and incremental heat rate curve data set most applicable to the current conditions.  On-line modification for fuel cost and heat rate data allow modeling of current unit conditions.

A study mode dispatch calculates economic basepoints for selected manually controlled units as well as for automatically controlled units.  For the most economic system operation, generating units should operate at basepoints determined from dispatch considering units operating in the AUTOMATIC, ECONOMIC, and MANUAL-DISPATCH control modes.  The results of this dispatch consist of economic basepoints, presented on CRT displays that serve only as operator recommendations.  In this dispatch, unit high and low economic limits constrain the basepoint calculation.

Economic Participation Factors

To accurately reflect actual system economics, the AGC function requires basepoints from a real-time dispatch considering only units operating in the AUTOMATIC and ECONOMIC control mode.  The results of this dispatch consist of economic basepoints and economic participation factors that are input to the AGC desired generation calculation.  The economic participation factors, a linear representation of the incremental cost function for each generating unit operating in the AUTOMATIC control mode, allow adjustment of the economic basepoints to compensate for the minor system load changes that occur between ED executions.

Their use reduces the ED function execution frequency without sacrificing economic operation.  In this dispatch, unit response rate limits as well as high and low economic limits constrain the basepoint calculation.

Penalty Factors

Penalty factors adjust the incremental cost for each generating unit to account for transmission losses incurred due to an incremental change in generation.  The ED function supports three penalty factor calculation methods, real-time, B-Matrix and constant coefficient.  The operator may select, via CRT display, the penalty factor calculation method to be used.

The Penalty Factor Calculation function derives real-time penalty factors using the Jacobian algorithm based on the current power system configuration and condition, as determined by the State Estimation function.  A CRT display presents the real-time penalty factors for each generating unit.

Penalty factors derived from B-matrix and constant coefficient methods account for transmission losses incurred in a specific power system configuration and condition.  The B-matrix penalty factor for a given generating unit is dependent on injections at prespecified power system busses, generally, where generating units, tie-lines and nonconforming loads are connected.  The constant coefficient penalty factor for a given generating unit is linearly proportional to the total system generation.  To provide more accurate assessments using these techniques, ED automatically selects from several sets of B-matrix and constant coefficient data, representing different power system configurations and conditions, based on the system load level.




Emission Dispatch (Option)

The Clean Air Act of 1990 defines a two phased reduction in the emissions of electric generation plants.  From 1995 to 2000, Phase I limits the SO2 emissions of pre-selected generating units.  Phase II becomes effective after the year 2000 and restricts SO2 and NOx emissions for all units over 25 MW.

The emission dispatch calculates generating unit basepoints that minimize the company production cost as well as constraint emissions to hourly emission limits determined by long range planning studies.

Initially, ED performs a dispatch based on generating unit fuel costs and heat rate characteristics.  The pertinent results of this minimum cost dispatch include unit basepoints, system production cost rate and system NOx and SO2 emission rate.  System production cost and emission rates are a summation of individual unit production cost and emission rates, calculated by integration of the incremental heat and emission rate curves to the unit basepoint.

ED performs a second dispatch based on generating unit fuel costs and composite heat and emission rate characteristics.  The composite heat and emission rate characteristics result from a summation of incremental cost curve breakpoints and cost-weighted incremental emission curve breakpoints.  The pertinent results of this dispatch include unit basepoints and system production cost rate and emission rates.

From the results of the two dispatches, ED calculates and emission improvement cost, i.e., the ratio of the increase in production cost to the decrease in emission.  If the emission improvement cost exceeds an operator specified maximum limit, indicating that a reduction in emission is not cost effective, the dispatch solution is complete even if the system emission rates exceed the emission rate limits.  This situation constitutes a recommendation to purchase emission improvement cost is less than an operator specified minimum limit, indicating that a small increase in fuel costs results in significant emission resolutions, ED increases the emission cost weighing factor and the solution continues.

ED compares the system emission rates with NO and SO2 emission rate limits derived from the hourly emission allowances calculated by long term planning functions.  The derived NOx and SO2 emission rate limits consider actual accumulated emissions and expected generation requirement changes.  If the system emission rate exceeds an emission rate limit, ED increases the corresponding emission cost weighing factor and performs another dispatch.  ED repeats the solution process until the system NOx and SO2 emission rates meet the emission rate limits or the emission improvement cost exceeds its limit.

The results of the emission dispatch include the following quantities:

Cost of compliance with emission limits
Optimum generating unit basepoints and participation factors
Expected hourly and instantaneous generating unit and total company emissions (SO2, NOx)
Hourly and instantaneous generating unit and total company fuel usage

Description of Economic Dispatch Also, provide in writing a detailed description of how Respondent calculates system lambda.  For those systems that do not use an economic dispatch algorithm and do not have a system lambda, provide in writing a detailed description of how control area resources are efficiently dispatched.


The CWLP system lambda is based on a system incremental heat rate calculated from the Energy Management System (EMS).  The EMS only includes units that are on control in calculating the system lambda.  The incremental system heat rate (mmBtu/MWH) is multiplied by the fuel cost ($/mmBTU) to arrive at the system lambda ($/MWH).   When a less efficient unit or more expensive unit, is on-line the system lambda calculated by the EMS is replaced by the lambda of the more espensive unit. Variable Operation & Maintenance (O&M) costs and transmission losses are not included in the system lambda calculations. 

CWLP participates in the Midwest ISO (MISO) energy market.  CWLP’s generators follow the dispatch base point signals received from the MISO every five minutes.  The units in the MISO energy market are dispatched based on price offer curves provided by market participants.  MISO dispatches units according to the Security Constrained Economic Dispatch (SCED).  MISO uses SCED to dispatch units in a manner that tries to minimize the overall cost of energy, based on the Locational Marginal Price (LMP).  The LMP includes the incremental energy offer of the most expensive unit used to serve the load and the cost of congestion and losses at every Commercial Pricing Point Node (CPn) in the system.  MISO also uses the Reliability Assessment Commitment (RAC) process to dispatch units for reliability in the bulk electric system which may override the SCED dispatch solution.

Firm-Load Lambda Calculation


The AEP System’s calculation of the firm-load lambda is based on the after-the-fact search for the generating unit that could have theoretically served one MW of additional firm demand, in addition to the actual firm demand.  If more than one generating unit were to be candidates to serve that additional MW, the one with the lowest incremental cost would be the one considered. 

The incremental energy cost, in $/MWh, to raise that unit’s loading by one MW above its actual loading is defined as the AEP System’s firm-load lambda.  Such determination and calculation are carried out on an hourly basis.  

Prior to determining that incremental generating unit and the associated incremental cost, the computer program is coded to take into consideration all appropriate realities and obligations encountered while the AEP System’s generation resources are operating on real-time.  These are:  (i) consideration of each operating generating unit’s seasonal capability, including condition deratings and partial outages, if any; (ii) exclusion of capacity blocks actually allocated to unit-power sales commitments; (iii) exclusion of the Donald C. Cook Nuclear Units Nos. 1 and 2 and conventional hydroelectric units from “incremental” consideration, inasmuch as those units generally operate to their physical and regulatory limits; and (iv) inclusion of the 3% spinning reserve requirement over the firm demand, as mandated by the ECAR Document No. 2.

Description of Economic Dispatch

Calculation of System lambda

The goal of economic dispatch is to match electric power resources with electricity demand and thus make the Area Control Error (ACE) zero at the lowest total cost.  For a given system generation requirement, the cheapest operating point occurs where the incremental power cost (lambda) for each controllable unit are equal.  The mathematical derivation proving the merits of equal lambda dispatch may be found in most power system analysis text books.  The controller must therefore be able to find the right system lambda and the desired generation of each unit at that lambda.

Economic (equal lambda) dispatch at Progress Energy Carolinas is achieved with the use of unit incremental heat rate curves, fuel costs, emissions costs and penalty factors for transmission losses.  The incremental cost curve for each generating unit is the product of the incremental heat rate curve (that considers emissions per MBTU of heat input) multiplied by the unit fuel cost and adjusted by the penalty factor to account for transmission losses.  While attempting to maintain an ACE of zero, thus serving load commitments, each unit’s incremental cost curve is set equal to the system incremental cost (lambda) to determine unit output (MW).  As load increases and generation increases to achieve a zero ACE, a new system lambda is selected in order to match generation with load.  An iterative process of selecting lambda and determining unit output until ACE is brought to zero is employed constantly on the Energy Management System.  As load diminishes, generation is reduced to balance resources with demand to achieve a zero ACE.  Here again, a new system lambda is selected and unit incremental cost curves evaluated to match generation with load.

PNM purchases under long term PPA (Prior Purchase Adjustment), the entire output of the Taiban Mesa Wind Farm (204 MWs).  This resource is dispatched as must take.

PNM Palo Verde nuclear generation is the lowest cost PNM generation resource.  It is also very undesirable to curtail Palo Verde nuclear generation from a plant operations perspective.  Therefore, PNM Palo Verde generation is always run at its full capability. 

PNM Four Corners generation is usually PNM's second lowest cost generation resource.  It is typically fully loaded, except when PNM load commitments are so low that Four Corners generation must be curtailed in order to keep the PNM Area Control Error at zero.  On occasion, when San Juan is lightly loaded, its incremental cost is less than Four Corners.  In those instances Four Corners generation is economically curtailed.

PNM Reeves is a gas plant located in Albuquerque.  It is started for load, for spinning reserves resources, for loadside used for transmission support, for conditional firm transmission sales, and for energy sales, if its operating costs are within the range of spot market costs.

Valencia is a gas plant located south of Albuquerque.  Its total output is purchased by PNM.  It is started for load, for reserves, for load side used for transmission support, to support conditional firm transmission sales, and for energy sales.  It is dispatched after Reeves and before Delta.

Delta-Person is a gas/oil plant located in Albuquerque.  Its total output is purchased by PNM and is dispatched economically, usually after Valencia generation. When on line, Delta-Person is on Automatic Generation Control to follow swings in PNM area control error (ACE).  It is started for load, to support conditional firm transmission sales, or for loadside used for transmission support.

Additional generation resources include PNM Las Vegas Combustion Turbine generation and PNM purchases from other utilities.


PNM System Lambda Calculation

Since PNM is not able to economically dispatch non-PNM Balancing Authority generation resources, the System Lambda calculation only includes PNM generation resources.  If generation resources having an incremental fuel cost less than the calculated San Juan lambda are being curtailed, the PNM Real Time Power Trader manually schedules the lower cost resource to replace the higher lambda San Juan resource.  The calculated San Juan lambda value is manually replaced with the lower value.  If the PNM San Juan generation resource is fully scheduled, except for unloaded capacity needed for regulation and spinning reserves, and PNM is using generation resources having a higher incremental fuel cost (such as purchased energy with a higher cost than the San Juan lambda), the PNM Real Time Power Trader replaces the previously calculated lambda value with the cost of the next incremental generation resource available to PNM.

to entirely by the LAP units of WAPA-RMR and 20 MW's of CRSP which are hydro-electric generation only.  WAPA-RMR has no 
ownership of or rights to any thermal resources.  Therefore, there is no lambda signal developed, recorded, or used in the operation of

their own minimal cost operating algorithm used for economic dispatch of their own resources.  These algorithms generaly include some

Economic Dispatch Solution Module (EDSOL)
Given a system total generation requirement, EDSOL determines the most economical generation level for all generators under economic dispatch control, taking into account the generators input-output characteristics, the generators fuel costs and the power losses over the transmission network.
A generating unit's input-output characteristics relate the fuel rate input, MBTU/HR, to the generator's power output (MW). This is usually known as the heat rate curve. The incremental heat rate curve, as the name implies, relates the incremental fuel rate input, MBTU/MWHR, to the generator's power output. Multiplying by the generator's selected fuel's cost, $/MBTU, the generator's incremental cost curve is obtained ($/MWHR vs. MW). The generator's efficiency value (in percent) is also incorporated (by normalization and division) into the determination of the generator's incremental cost curve coefficients. The incremental heat rate curve is linearized and defined by up to eighteen straight- line segments. Each segment is defined by its two end points.
Mathematically, the economic dispatch problem can be expressed as the minimization of the generation cost, which is defined as:
	C = S ci (Pi)						(1)
Where
	C	=	generation cost
	Pi	=	output power of generator i
	ci (Pi)	=	fuel cost for Pi
Subject to the following constraints:
	Pmini £ Pi £ Pmaxi					(2)
	S Pi = Load + Loss (P1. Pi, ...)			(3)
Where
	Pmini	=	minimum power of generator i
	Pmaxi	=	maximum power of generator i
	Load	=	system load
	Loss	=	line losses
Now, consider the augmented Lagrange cost function:
	£ = C - l (S Pi - Load - Loss)				(4)
The optimal solution is given by:
	¶£ = 0
	¶Pi							(5)

i.e.,	¶Ci (Pi)      -      l (1 - ¶ Loss)   = 0
	  ¶ Pi                             ¶ Pi
Which gives the optimal coordination equations:
	l = Pfi    ¶Ci (Pi)						(6)
                                       ¶Pi
Where
	Pfi   =       1      		is the penalty factor of generator i.
                  1 - ¶ Loss
                        ¶ Pi
Equation (6) shows that the optimal dispatch is achieved when all generators operate at equal incremental cost l.
Calculating the penalty factors Pfi, which are a measure of transmission losses, requires the solution of load flow equations.
The Economic Dispatch Solution routine's (EDSOL's) caller normally obtains the penalty factors from the database as calculated by Network Analysis. They can alternately be set by the user or set to unity (1.0).
Any Power Application that provides the appropriate set of input data can utilize EDSOL routine. The caller can optionally direct EDSOL to obtain certain input data, such as generators incremental heat rate curves coefficients and generators fuel selections and costs, directly from the appropriate database tables.
EDSOL begins its processing by adjusting the caller's total required generation to reflect the outputs available from off-control or from base loaded generators. The adjusted value is EDSOL's total required generation from among the economically dispatched generators. In the case of the Economic Dispatch Control (EDC) calling EDSOL, EDSOL develops its total required generation by summing the current actual MW outputs of the economically dispatched generators.
If EDSOL finds that its total required generation can not be satisfied due to being out of range of the EDC High or EDC Low limits sum, then each dispatched generator's desired generation value is set equal to the appropriate EDC limit before returning to the caller. EDSOL also returns the appropriate solution status indication, which the caller can check to detect and possibly act upon (such as by alerting the dispatcher or user) the situation.
EDSOL develops each dispatched generator's incremental cost curve coefficients, as described above, and determines the system's maximum and minimum possible values of Lambda as the initial bounds of the iterative Lambda search.
The set of simultaneous equations described above is solved iteratively by establishing a trial value of Lambda to calculate each dispatched generator's desired power output and the system sum of the desired power outputs. If the system sum of the desired power outputs matches (within a designated tolerance) EDSOL's total required generation, then the iterative Lambda search terminates. Otherwise, the trial value of Lambda is adjusted (using a binary search protected Newton's method adjustment) and another iteration's calculations are performed. The output of the terminated Lambda search is a tentative set of desired output values that are within the generators EDC High and EDC Low limits and will satisfy EDSOL's total required generation.
Each generator's tentative desired output is checked against the generator's designated and calculated disallowed regions. If one or more generator's tentative desired output is found to be within a disallowed region, then one such generator is selected to have its desired output subsequently clamped to the appropriate edge of the disallowed region. With that generator effectively removed from the solution calculations, EDSOL returns to again perform the iterative Lambda search among the reduced set of economically dispatched generators, and then again check for the need to move a generator's desired output value out of a disallowed region.
The disallowed regions check loop is terminated once EDSOL finds that no generator's desired output lies within a disallowed region.
If it is not possible to find a closely matching economic dispatch solution (the designated or calculated disallowed regions cause the economic dispatch solution problem to be excessively constrained), then EDSOL returns the appropriate solution status indication to the caller.
EDSOL returns to the caller the calculated value of Lambda and the set of desired outputs for the economically dispatched generators.

SYSTEM LAMBDA DESCRIPTION

Given a system load, the Energy Management System (EMS) determines the most economical generation level for all units under economic dispatch control, taking into account the units' input-output characteristics, fuel costs, variable maintenance costs, power loses over the transmission network, and emission allowance costs.

A generating unit's input-output characteristics relate fuel rate input (MBTU/HR) to the unit's power output (MW).  This is usually referred to as the heat rate cure.  The incremental heat rate curve, as the name implies, relates the incremental fuel rate input (MBTU/MWHR) to the unit's power output (MW).  Multiplying by the composit fuel cost ($/MBTU), the unit's incremental cost curve - unit lambda - is obtained ($/MWHR vs. MW)  The curve is linearized into seven segments.

The system incremental cost - system lambda - is developed from the individual units with their associated power output constraints.  The optimal dispatch is achieved when all available units operate at equal incremental cost.",0

211,2008,12,0,100,,"Day-Ahead Market (DAM)

The DAM sets prices as of 11:00 AM the previous day (thus the term day-ahead) based on generation and energy transaction bids that were offered in advance to the NYISO.  DAM prices are determined on an hourly basis for each of the state's eleven zones and for the four neighboring areas (New England, Hydro Quebec, Ontario Hydro and PJM).  Typically more than 90% of energy transactions processed by NYISO occur in the DAM.  A software program called Security Constrained Unit Commitment determines the amount of energy expected to be needed within the state for each day.  NYISO will schedule the generating units that can most economically satisfy the energy needed to supply customers' demand and allow a sufficient reserve for contingencies.  The New York Marginal Cost of Energy is the base price that NYISO must pay to obtain the needed energy.  This base price is determined at the NYISO reference bus, so named because it is the reference against which losses, congestion, shift factors, penalty factors and other system mathematical quantities are calculated.  It is physically located at the March 345 kV substation in Marcy, New York.  In transmitting energy across the state, there are additional costs for the electrical losses and sometimes for congestion when transmission lines become overloaded.  The DAM zonal Local Based Marginal Prices are determined by adding the marginal cost of energy, the marginal cost of losses and the marginal cost of congestion.

2008 ECONOMIC DISPATCH WITH MULTIPLE FUEL PRICES


1.0 FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION

	The proposed Econimic Dispatch software enhancement is designed to provide the capability for Chugach to economically dispatch their generation subject to these additional constraints.

	When gas flow at Beluga exceeds a specified amount, all additional gas is provided at a different price from the base load gas.

	Dispatch power for incremental sales to GVEA on top of Chugach generation at a different price from the Chugach fuel price.


2.0 IMPLEMENTATION

	The new Economic Dispatch uses the existing algorithm, as described in the attached Appendix A, to perform the basic dispatch.  However, the overall economic dispatch is now performed in three passes.  These three passes are designated Base dispatch, Secondary dispatch and GVEA dispatch.  The sequence of calculation is given below:

Base Dispatch

	-  Set load to actual load less the GVEA load.  Use actual unit limits and the base fuel price.

	-  Dispatch the generation to meet the load.


Secondary Dispatch

	If Beluga gas exceeds the base gas consumption limit:

	  -  Dispatch tothe base gas limit

	  -  Set the low limits to the dispatched unit outputs.  Use the secondary fuel prices.

	  -  Dispatch the generation to meet the load.

	  -  Set load to actual load, including the GVEA load.  Set the low limits to the dispatched unit outputs.  Use the GVEA fuel prices.

	  -  Dispatch the generation to meet the load.



APPENDIX A

METHOD OF CALCULATION

The coordination equations to be solved by EDC are:

(CJ* df/dpj + Imj) * PFj = LAMBDA

Where: Cj		= Fuel cost for the jth unit.

             dfj/dpj	=Incremental heat rate for the jth unit.

             IMj		=Incremental maintenance cost for the jth unit.

             PFj		=Penalty Factor for the jth unit.
		  Used to bias entire unit cost.

             LAMBDA        	=Incremental cost of supplying power to a hypothetical load center of the area.

In addition to the coordination equations, the following power balance equation must be satisfied:

SUM OF Basepoints of
               dispatched		= SUM OF 		Actual generation of dispatched units (at beginning of dispatch)
               generation	
              (at end of dispatch)

			+ SUM OF		rate-limited difference between base points and current generation of units on ramp, base load, or base load and regulating


			+DG

Where: DG is normally FACE, but is limited to the maximum MW all units on control may move during the interval between EDC executions. DC always has the same sign as FACE.

The EDC routine consists of an inner and outer loop.   The inner loop is a binary search routine for  solving the coordination equations in order to obtain base points for a fixed value of LAMBDA.

During this solution it is necessary, of course, to recognize the high and low economic limits and the calculated high and low rate limits.  Once the base points have been determined an outer loop calculation is made to see if the power balance equation is satisfied.  If not, LAMBDA is adjusted, the inner loop is then reentered and a new set of base poins calculated.

This proceedure will continue until one of these conditions is met:

1.  Both the coordination equations and the power balance equation are satisfied to within specified tolerances.

2.  Either the coordination equations or the power balance equation does not converse because of numerical or physical problems.  In this case a message is sent to the sytem console.

Assuming that a valid solution is obtained, the economic participation factors are computed for those units which are to follow load.  The base points and economic participation factors (for the load following units) are then updated for use by the AGC routines.  The economic participation factors for the units which are not load following are set to zero.

Economic participation factors are calculated by assuming that the slope of the LAMBDA versus generation curve is constant over a short range.  The load is increased by a percentage.  DELEDC, and a new dispatch is made.  Economic participation factors for load above the sum of base points are then calculated:

UEPFUPj = (change in unit j generation)/ (change in system load)

The load is then decreased to the same percentage below its original value, and a new dispatch is made.  Economic participation factors for the load below the sum of base points are calculated in the same way as the increasing ones.

EDC utilizes the Auto-Ranging Binary Search method.  It operates by dividing the search region into two, deciding which half the desired result is in, dividing that half into two, and so on until a solution is obtained.  Starting with the desired generation DESGEN (=sum of all generation from telemetry + FACE)  and an initial value of LAMBDA (usually the value from the last EDC)< the calculation proceeds until the error (MWn-DESGEN) is less than a set fraction of DESGEN.  This fraction, ERRTPW, resides in the database.

The binary search algorithm will always work for the Economic Dispatch Calculation when given a realistic set of conditions.  Discountinuous heat rate curve is also supported. Discontinuous curves have slopes that are infinite at certain points.",0

Description of Economic Dispatch


The Southern Company system lambda is determined hourly and is based on the variable
costs of the resources that serve the load obligations of the Operating Companies plus any
sales to third parties.  The variable costs of the resources include the components listed
below, and may also reflect the cost of purchases.  The economic dispatch formula used
to dispatch Southern’s generating resources on the basis of their variable cost components
is as follows:

	Where:
	l  	= System lambda
	a, b	= Incremental heat rate coefficients
	P	= Generation level
	FC	= Marginal replacement fuel costs
	EC	= Marginal replacement emission allowance costs
	VOM	= Variable operations and maintenance expenses
	FH	= In-plant fuel handling expenses
	TPF	= Incremental transmission losses (penalty factors)

209,2008,12,0,100,,"NPPD uses an economic disptach algorithm to calculate the system lambda.  Several sub-functions are used to perform these calculations.

The first sub-function is the incremental cost calculation for each unit.  The incremental cost is calculated as follows:

Where:  ICi = Incremental cost
IMCi = Incremental maintenance cost
IHRi = Incremental heat rate
FCi = Fuel Cost
EFi = Efficiency factor

The next sub-function is the Dispatch Solution sub-function.  It calculates a lambda and economic base points for all units using the Generation Allocation sub-function.  The dispatch for each unit is constrained by the operation limits of the unit.  A total system lambda is calculated from the total of the individual unit lambdas.

The Generation Allocation sub-function economically allocates the generation requirements for units.  The Generation To Be Dispatched (GTBD) is calculated as the sum of the previous base points plus the additional temporary generation (ACE plus Frequency Bias) provided from LFC.  The main algorithm uses a Minimization of System Production Cost equatation.  The equations from the optimum megawatt dispatch are dervied by the method of Lagrange multipliers.

ISO New England calculates locational marginal prices rather than system lambda. Locational Marginal Price (LMP) is defined as the marginal price for Energy at the Location where the Energy is  delivered or received and is made up of three components: the Energy Component, the Congestion Component and the Loss Component. 
 
LMPs result from the application of a linear optimization method to minimize energy, congestion, and transmission loss costs, given system conditions and constraints, while satisfying energy and  operating reserve needs for the entire New England Control Area. The process yields the three components of LMPs:  
 
               LMP ($/MW) = Energy Component + Loss Component + Congestion Component  
 
The Energy Component is based on unit-submitted supply offers for generating an amount of MWh for a particular hour. 

Section 1 The Energy Component is the same for all locations. The Loss Component reflects the marginal cost of system losses specific to each Location, while the Congestion Component  represents the individual location’s marginal transmission congestion cost as impacted by all binding constraints including local Operating Reserve Requirements in Real-Time.

The following discussion describes PGE's 2008 Balancing Authority resources and how it dispatches them to meet its Balancing Authority demand.  

PGE's Resources

PGE Balancing Authority resources include:  eight wholly owned hydroelectric generating plants, the purchase of the output of four hydroelectric generating plants, two jointly owned coal-fired generating plants, two wholly owned combined cycle combustion turbine plants, one PURPA contract thermal generating plant, one PURPA contract hydroelectric generating plant, three non-PURPA contract hydroelectric generating plants and one non-utility thermal generating plant.

Dispatch of PGE's Resources

Demand following is accomplished by sending the AGC signal either directly to PGE's Round Butte hydroelectric generating plant or to the control center which coordinates the operation of PGE's four purchased hydroelectric generating plants.  This control center coordinates the operation of several hydroelectric generating plants for the plant owners and purchasers.

The individual units of the remaining seven of PGE's wholly owned and three non-PURPA hydroelectric generating plants are typically operated at a fixed hourly generating output that is based on river flow, reservoir elevation, unit availability, license constraints and the regional coordination of hydroelectric plant operation.

PGE also commits the individual units of its thermal generating plants based on unit availability and energy market conditions.  These plants do not receive an automatic generation control (AGC) signal.  The determination of the fixed hourly outputs of these thermal generating plants takes into account a number of factors including:  the cost and availability of fuel, the availability of PGE's and regional hydroelectric generating plants, the energy market and the terms of the joint operating agreements.

Economic Dispatch Solution Module (EDSOL)
Given a system total generation requirement, EDSOL determines the most economical generation level for all generators under economic dispatch control, taking into account the generators input-output characteristics, the generators fuel costs and the power losses over the transmission network.
A generating unit's input-output characteristics relate the fuel rate input, MBTU/HR, to the generator's power output (MW). This is usually known as the heat rate curve. The incremental heat rate curve, as the name implies, relates the incremental fuel rate input, MBTU/MWHR, to the generator's power output. Multiplying by the generator's selected fuel's cost, $/MBTU, the generator's incremental cost curve is obtained ($/MWHR vs. MW). The generator's efficiency value (in percent) is also incorporated (by normalization and division) into the determination of the generator's incremental cost curve coefficients. The incremental heat rate curve is linearized and defined by up to eighteen straight- line segments. Each segment is defined by its two end points.
Mathematically, the economic dispatch problem can be expressed as the minimization of the generation cost, which is defined as:
	C = S ci (Pi)						(1)
Where
	C	=	generation cost
	Pi	=	output power of generator i
	ci (Pi)	=	fuel cost for Pi
Subject to the following constraints:
	Pmini £ Pi £ Pmaxi					(2)
	S Pi = Load + Loss (P1. Pi, ...)			(3)
Where
	Pmini	=	minimum power of generator i
	Pmaxi	=	maximum power of generator i
	Load	=	system load
	Loss	=	line losses
Now, consider the augmented Lagrange cost function:
	£ = C - l (S Pi - Load - Loss)				(4)
The optimal solution is given by:
	¶£ = 0
	¶Pi							(5)

i.e.,	¶Ci (Pi)      -      l (1 - ¶ Loss)   = 0
	  ¶ Pi                             ¶ Pi
Which gives the optimal coordination equations:
	l = Pfi    ¶Ci (Pi)						(6)
                                       ¶Pi
Where
	Pfi   =       1      		is the penalty factor of generator i.
                  1 - ¶ Loss
                        ¶ Pi
Equation (6) shows that the optimal dispatch is achieved when all generators operate at equal incremental cost l.
Calculating the penalty factors Pfi, which are a measure of transmission losses, requires the solution of load flow equations.
The Economic Dispatch Solution routine's (EDSOL's) caller normally obtains the penalty factors from the database as calculated by Network Analysis. They can alternately be set by the user or set to unity (1.0).
Any Power Application that provides the appropriate set of input data can utilize EDSOL routine. The caller can optionally direct EDSOL to obtain certain input data, such as generators incremental heat rate curves coefficients and generators fuel selections and costs, directly from the appropriate database tables.
EDSOL begins its processing by adjusting the caller's total required generation to reflect the outputs available from off-control or from base loaded generators. The adjusted value is EDSOL's total required generation from among the economically dispatched generators. In the case of the Economic Dispatch Control (EDC) calling EDSOL, EDSOL develops its total required generation by summing the current actual MW outputs of the economically dispatched generators.
If EDSOL finds that its total required generation can not be satisfied due to being out of range of the EDC High or EDC Low limits sum, then each dispatched generator's desired generation value is set equal to the appropriate EDC limit before returning to the caller. EDSOL also returns the appropriate solution status indication, which the caller can check to detect and possibly act upon (such as by alerting the dispatcher or user) the situation.
EDSOL develops each dispatched generator's incremental cost curve coefficients, as described above, and determines the system's maximum and minimum possible values of Lambda as the initial bounds of the iterative Lambda search.
The set of simultaneous equations described above is solved iteratively by establishing a trial value of Lambda to calculate each dispatched generator's desired power output and the system sum of the desired power outputs. If the system sum of the desired power outputs matches (within a designated tolerance) EDSOL's total required generation, then the iterative Lambda search terminates. Otherwise, the trial value of Lambda is adjusted (using a binary search protected Newton's method adjustment) and another iteration's calculations are performed. The output of the terminated Lambda search is a tentative set of desired output values that are within the generators EDC High and EDC Low limits and will satisfy EDSOL's total required generation.
Each generator's tentative desired output is checked against the generator's designated and calculated disallowed regions. If one or more generator's tentative desired output is found to be within a disallowed region, then one such generator is selected to have its desired output subsequently clamped to the appropriate edge of the disallowed region. With that generator effectively removed from the solution calculations, EDSOL returns to again perform the iterative Lambda search among the reduced set of economically dispatched generators, and then again check for the need to move a generator's desired output value out of a disallowed region.
The disallowed regions check loop is terminated once EDSOL finds that no generator's desired output lies within a disallowed region.
If it is not possible to find a closely matching economic dispatch solution (the designated or calculated disallowed regions cause the economic dispatch solution problem to be excessively constrained), then EDSOL returns the appropriate solution status indication to the caller.
EDSOL returns to the caller the calculated value of Lambda and the set of desired outputs for the economically dispatched generators. Other data is also made available for the caller, such as the solution's status indication (Normal In Range Solution, Constrained By EDC High Limits Sum, etc.), a list of the indices of the economically dispatched generators and the set of calculated (pseudo) disallowed regions to be avoided to limit the starting or stopping of mills.

The Economic Dispatch (ED) function establishes the optimum basepoints for the in-service economically dispatchable thermal generating units in a manner than minimizes the total system production cost, considering the effects of transmission losses, while respecting unit economic and response rate limits.

Significant Features and Benefits

Event triggered ED executions, following relevant changes in power system or generating unit conditions, ensure the timely calculation of optimum basepoints.  Economic participation factors, representing a linear approximation of the ED function, allow adjustment of optimum basepoints to compensate for minor system load changes occurring between ED executions.

The emission constraints of the 1990 Clean Air act can be included in the Economic Dispatch function as an option.

A dual dispatch approach advises the operator of optimum basepoints for selected manually controlled units as well as for automatically controlled units.

Actual and ideal production cost differences reveal system regulation costs and the cost of manually controlled unit operation at nonoptimum basepoints.

Use of real-time penalty factors, derived by security analysis functions (if provided), to account for transmission losses provides the most accurate analysis, ensuring the maximum possible fuel savings.

B-matrix and constant coefficient penalty factor calculation methods account for transmission losses when real-time penalty factors are not available.

Multiple fuel cost and heat rate curve data sets allow modeling of different fuel types and operating conditions for each generating unit.

Technical Overview

Activation Mechanism

The real-time ED function calculates optimum basepoints for the dispatchable thermal generating units on a periodic, operator demand, or event triggered basis.  ED executes periodically when a tunable maximum time period between basepoint calculations, typically five-minutes, has elapsed.  The operator may request execution of the ED function via the CRT displays.  To ensure the most economical system operation, ED also executes as a result of the following events.

The control area load changes significantly since the last basepoint calculation

The control area net interchange changes significantly since the last basepoint calculation

The dispatch status of a generating unit changes

The Automatic Generation Control function, using economic participation factors, adjusts the economic basepoint of a dispatchable generating unit to an economic limit

The operator modifies generating unit fuel cost or heat rate curve data

A tunable minimum time period between basepoint calculations prevents excessive event triggered ED executions.

Economic Basepoint Calculations

ED obtains the most economic system operation when the incremental cost of power delivered to the load is the same for all dispatchable generating units.  Calculation of the unit economic basepoints involves the solution of a set of coordination equations of the following form via a Lagrangian method:

	FCOSTi * dli/dPi;=LAMBDA/PFi

Subject to the constraint equation:

	   n
	?P?= DISPGEN
	   1

where:

	LAMBDA	=  	system incremental cost ($/MW.h)
	FCOSTi	=  	fuel cost for unit ?($/MMBTU)
	dl?/dP?	=  	incremental heat rate for unit i (MMBTU/MW.h)
	PF?        	=  	penalty factor for unit ?
	P?  	=  	economic basepoint for unit ?(MW)
	n  	=  	number of generating units dispatched
	DISPGEN 	= 		total dispatched generation (MW)

A variable number of straight line segments, defined by monotonically increasing ordinates and abscissas, approximate the generating unit incremental heat rate curves.  Multiple fuel cost and incremental heat rate curve data sets, typically six for each generating unit, permit modeling of different fuel types and/or unit operating conditions.  CRT displays allow operator selection of the fuel cost and incremental heat rate curve data set most applicable to the current conditions.  On-line modification for fuel cost and heat rate data allow modeling of current unit conditions.

A study mode dispatch calculates economic basepoints for selected manually controlled units as well as for automatically controlled units.  For the most economic system operation, generating units should operate at basepoints determined from dispatch considering units operating in the AUTOMATIC, ECONOMIC, and MANUAL-DISPATCH control modes.  The results of this dispatch consist of economic basepoints, presented on CRT displays that serve only as operator recommendations.  In this dispatch, unit high and low economic limits constrain the basepoint calculation.

Economic Participation Factors

To accurately reflect actual system economics, the AGC function requires basepoints from a real-time dispatch considering only units operating in the AUTOMATIC and ECONOMIC control mode.  The results of this dispatch consist of economic basepoints and economic participation factors that are input to the AGC desired generation calculation.  The economic participation factors, a linear representation of the incremental cost function for each generating unit operating in the AUTOMATIC control mode, allow adjustment of the economic basepoints to compensate for the minor system load changes that occur between ED executions.

Their use reduces the ED function execution frequency without sacrificing economic operation.  In this dispatch, unit response rate limits as well as high and low economic limits constrain the basepoint calculation.

Penalty Factors

Penalty factors adjust the incremental cost for each generating unit to account for transmission losses incurred due to an incremental change in generation.  The ED function supports three penalty factor calculation methods, real-time, B-Matrix and constant coefficient.  The operator may select, via CRT display, the penalty factor calculation method to be used.

The Penalty Factor Calculation function derives real-time penalty factors using the Jacobian algorithm based on the current power system configuration and condition, as determined by the State Estimation function.  A CRT display presents the real-time penalty factors for each generating unit.

Penalty factors derived from B-matrix and constant coefficient methods account for transmission losses incurred in a specific power system configuration and condition.  The B-matrix penalty factor for a given generating unit is dependent on injections at prespecified power system busses, generally, where generating units, tie-lines and nonconforming loads are connected.  The constant coefficient penalty factor for a given generating unit is linearly proportional to the total system generation.  To provide more accurate assessments using these techniques, ED automatically selects from several sets of B-matrix and constant coefficient data, representing different power system configurations and conditions, based on the system load level.




Emission Dispatch (Option)

The Clean Air Act of 1990 defines a two phased reduction in the emissions of electric generation plants.  From 1995 to 2000, Phase I limits the SO2 emissions of pre-selected generating units.  Phase II becomes effective after the year 2000 and restricts SO2 and NOx emissions for all units over 25 MW.

The emission dispatch calculates generating unit basepoints that minimize the company production cost as well as constraint emissions to hourly emission limits determined by long range planning studies.

Initially, ED performs a dispatch based on generating unit fuel costs and heat rate characteristics.  The pertinent results of this minimum cost dispatch include unit basepoints, system production cost rate and system NOx and SO2 emission rate.  System production cost and emission rates are a summation of individual unit production cost and emission rates, calculated by integration of the incremental heat and emission rate curves to the unit basepoint.

ED performs a second dispatch based on generating unit fuel costs and composite heat and emission rate characteristics.  The composite heat and emission rate characteristics result from a summation of incremental cost curve breakpoints and cost-weighted incremental emission curve breakpoints.  The pertinent results of this dispatch include unit basepoints and system production cost rate and emission rates.

From the results of the two dispatches, ED calculates and emission improvement cost, i.e., the ratio of the increase in production cost to the decrease in emission.  If the emission improvement cost exceeds an operator specified maximum limit, indicating that a reduction in emission is not cost effective, the dispatch solution is complete even if the system emission rates exceed the emission rate limits.  This situation constitutes a recommendation to purchase emission improvement cost is less than an operator specified minimum limit, indicating that a small increase in fuel costs results in significant emission resolutions, ED increases the emission cost weighing factor and the solution continues.

ED compares the system emission rates with NO and SO2 emission rate limits derived from the hourly emission allowances calculated by long term planning functions.  The derived NOx and SO2 emission rate limits consider actual accumulated emissions and expected generation requirement changes.  If the system emission rate exceeds an emission rate limit, ED increases the corresponding emission cost weighing factor and performs another dispatch.  ED repeats the solution process until the system NOx and SO2 emission rates meet the emission rate limits or the emission improvement cost exceeds its limit.

The results of the emission dispatch include the following quantities:

Cost of compliance with emission limits
Optimum generating unit basepoints and participation factors
Expected hourly and instantaneous generating unit and total company emissions (SO2, NOx)
Hourly and instantaneous generating unit and total company fuel usage

2009 ECOMONIC DISPATCH WITH MULTIPLE FUEL PRICES

1.0 FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION

	The proposed Econimic Dispatch software enhancement is designed to provide the capability for Chugach to economically dispatch their generation subject to these additional constraints.

	When gas flow at Beluga exceeds a specificed amount, all additional gas is provided at a different price from the base load gas.

	Dispatch power for incremental sales to GVEA on top of Chugach generation at a different price from the Chugach fuel price.

2.0 IMPLEMENTATION

	The new Economic Dispatch uses the existing algorithm,as described in the attached Appendix A, to perform the basic dispatch.  However, the overall ecomonic dispatch is now performed in three passes.  These three passes are designated Base dispatch, Secondary dispatch and GVEA dispatch.  The sequence of calculation is given below:

BASE DISPATCH

		-Set load to actual load less the GVEA load.  Use actual unit limits and the base fuel price.

		-Dispatch the generation to meet the load.

SECONDARY DISPATCH

		-Dispatch to the base gas limit
		-Set thelow limits to the dispatched unit outputs. Use the secondary fuel prices.
		-Set load to actual load, including the GVEA load.  Set the low limits to the dispatched unit outputs.  Use the GVEA fuel prices.
		-Dispatch the generation to meet the load.

METHOD OFCALCULATION

The coordination equations to be solved by EDC are:

(CJ* df/dpj + Imj) * PFj = LAMBDA

Where: 	Cj 		=Fuel cost for th jth unit.
	dfj/dpj		=Incremental heat rate for the jth unit.
	IMj		=Incremental maintenance cost for the jth unit.
	PFj		=Penalty Factor for the jth unit.
			  Used to bias entire unit cost.
	LAMBDA		=Incremental cost of supplying power to a hypothetical load center of the area.

In addition to the coordination equations, the following power balance equation must be satisfied:

SUM OF Basepoints of 
               dispatched		=SUM OF		Actual generation of dispatched units (at beginning of dispatch)
              
               generation		+ SUM OF		rate-limited difference between base points and current generation of units on ramp, base load, or base load and regulating

			+DC
Where: DG is normally FACE, but is limited to the maximum MW all units on control may move during the interval between EDC executions.  DC always has the same sign as FACE

The EDC routine consists of an inner and outer loop.  The inner loop is a binary serach routine for solving the coordination equations in order to obtain base points for a fixed value of LAMBDA.

During this solution it is necessary, of course, to recognize the high and low ecomonic limits and the calculated high and low rate limits.  Once the base points have been determined an outer loop calculation is made to see if the power balance equation is satisfied.  If not, LAMBDA is adjusted, the inner loop is then reentered and a new set of base points calculated. 

This proceedure will continue until one of these conditions is met:

1.  Both the coordination equations and the power balance equation are satisfied to within specified tolerances.

2.  Either the coordination equations or the power balance equation does not converse because of numerical or physical problems.  In this case a message is sent to the system console.

Assuming that a valid solution is obtained, the ecomonic participation factors are computed for those units  which are to follow load.  The base points and exonimic participation factors (for the load following units) are then updated for use by the AGC routines.  The ecomonic participation factors for the units which are not load following are set to zero.

Economic participation factors are calculated by assuming that the slope of the LAMBDA versus genration curve is constant over a short range.  The load is increased by a percentage.  DELEDC, and a new dispatch is made.  Ecomonic participation factors for load above thesum of base points are then calculated:

UEPFUPj = (change in unit j generation)/(change in system load)

The load is then decreased to the same percentage below its original value, and a new dispatch is made.  Ecomonic participation factors for the load below the sum of base points are calculated in the same way as the increasing ones.

EDC utilizes the Auto-Ranging Binary Search method.  It operates by dividing the search region into two, deciding which half the desired result is in, dividing that half into two, and so on until a solution is obtained.  Starting with the desired generation DESGEN (=sum of all generatin from telemetry + FACE) and an initial value of LAMBDA (usually the value from the last EDC),the calculation proceeds until the error (MWn-DESGEN) is less than a set fraction of DESGEN.  This fraction, ERRTWP< resides in the database.

The binary search algorithm will always work for the Economic Dispatch Calculation when given a realistic set of conditions.  Discontinuous heat rate curve is also supported.  Discontinuous curves have slopes that are infinite at certain points.

The AEP System’s calculation of the firm-load lambda is based on the after-the-fact search for the generating unit that could have theoretically served one MW of additional firm demand, in addition to the actual firm demand.  If more than one generating unit were to be candidates to serve that additional MW, the one with the lowest incremental cost would be the one considered. 

The incremental energy cost, in $/MWh, to raise that unit’s loading by one MW above its actual loading is defined as the AEP System’s firm-load lambda.  Such determination and calculation are carried out on an hourly basis.  

Prior to determining that incremental generating unit and the associated incremental cost, the computer program is coded to take into consideration all appropriate realities and obligations encountered while the AEP System’s generation resources are operating on real-time.  These are:  (i) consideration of each operating generating unit’s seasonal capability, including condition deratings and partial outages, if any; (ii) exclusion of capacity blocks actually allocated to unit-power sales commitments; (iii) exclusion of the Donald C.

Description of PNM Balancing Authority Economic Dispatch
Per Instructions on Part II - Schedule 6

PNM Balancing Authority Economic Dispatch

Since there are no agreements for PNM economic dispatch of non-PNM generation resources within the PNM Balancing Authority, each utility within the PNM Balancing Authority independently performs economic dispatch of their own generation resources.  The majority of PNM Balancing Authority generation resources belong to PNM.  PNM generation resources are economically dispatched as follows:

PNM purchases under long term PPA (Prior Purchase Adjustment), the entire output of the Taiban Mesa Wind Farm (204 MWs).  This resource is dispatched as must take.

PNM Palo Verde nuclear generation is the lowest cost PNM generation resource.  It is also very undesirable to curtail Palo Verde nuclear generation from a plant operations perspective.  Therefore, PNM Palo Verde generation is always run at its full capability. 

PNM San Juan generation is typically the next lowest cost PNM generation resource.  That generation is on Automatic Generation Control to follow swings in PNM area control error (ACE).   PNM ownership of San Juan units is spread over four units.  PNM's Energy Management System (EMS) is equipped with an economic dispatch function.  

PNM Four Corners generation is usually PNM's next resource in the dispatch stack.  It does not provide AGC, it is typically fully loaded, except when the spot market is lower than the Four Corners incremental cost.    

PNM has a purchase from Southwestern Public Service Co. (SPS) that has an energy price, which varies on a monthly basis.  That energy price is historically above the San Juan and Four Corners incremental energy generation cost.

PNM owns one third of the Luna Energy Facility.  This is a two on one combined cycle gas unit with an optimum heat rate of 7200.  This Luna unit is on Automatic Generation Control (AGC) and is dispatched in economic basis after the SPS contract.

PNM owns 100% of the Afton Power Plant.  This plant is a one on one combined cycle gas plant with an optimum heat rate of 7200.

Lordsburg Generating Station is a gas only turbine located in southern New Mexico, owned and operated by PNM.  It is started for load, regulation or for spinning reserves resources, provided transmission is purchased to the delivery point, and for energy sales, if its operating costs are within the range of spot market costs.

PNM Reeves is a gas plant located in Albuquerque.  It is started for load, for spinning reserves resources, for loadside used for transmission support, for conditional firm transmission sales, and for energy sales, if its operating costs are within the range of spot market costs.

Valencia is a gas plant located south of Albuquerque.  Its total output is purchased by PNM.  It is started for load, for reserves, for load side used for transmission support, to support conditional firm transmission sales, and for energy sales.  It is typically dispatched after Reeves and before Delta.  However, Valencia can come online much more quickly than Reeves, so in the event of a unit trip, Valencia may be brought online instead of Reeves.  

Delta-Person is a gas/oil plant located in Albuquerque.  Its total output is purchased by PNM and is dispatched economically, usually after Valencia generation. When on line, Delta-Person is on Automatic Generation Control to follow swings in PNM area control error (ACE).  It is started for load, to support conditional firm transmission sales, or for loadside used for transmission support.  It can also be brought online to recover from a unit trip; in such cases it may be brought online before Reeves or Valencia. 

Additional generation resources include PNM Las Vegas Combustion Turbine generation and PNM purchases from other utilities.


PNM System Lambda Calculation

Since PNM is not able to economically dispatch non-PNM Balancing Authority generation resources, the System Lambda calculation only includes PNM generation resources.  If generation resources having an incremental fuel cost less than the calculated San Juan lambda are being curtailed, the PNM Real Time Power Trader manually schedules the lower cost resource to replace the higher lambda San Juan resource.  The calculated San Juan lambda value is manually replaced with the lower value.  If the PNM San Juan generation resource is fully scheduled, except for unloaded capacity needed for regulation and spinning reserves, and PNM is using generation resources having a higher incremental fuel cost (such as purchased energy with a higher cost than the San Juan lambda), the PNM Real Time Power Trader replaces the previously calculated lambda value with the cost of the next incremental generation resource available to PNM.

116,2009,12,0,100,,"5.5  Economic Allocation - Lambda Dispatch

The Lambda algorithm function determines generator base points and allocates additional reserve to determine new dispatch limits prior to the final base point calculation.

The classical Lambda algorithm solution technique is employed along with additional features that are described below.  The algorithm solution provides a set of generation levels and inverse slopes of the incremental cost curve.  The slope values are later applied for the determination of economic participation factors.

The following notation is used:

P			-	generation MW for a unit being dispatched
Sum p	-	Sum of individual p values being dispatched
DMW	-	total dispatch MW
c			-	generator unit cost curve; c(p) = cost at p output
L			-	Lagrange multiplier whose solution value will be the solution Lambda 

5.5.1  Classical Iterative Approach

The objective of the Lambda algorithm is to find a set of generation p values at minimum total cost for a given desired MW value, DMW:

DMW = SUM p

Since the total cost function is the sum of individual (non-linear) cost functions, the classical Lagrange multiplier method minimizes the augmented cost function F:

F = Sum c(p) + L * (Sum p - PD - TL)

subject to:

MNDP £ p £MXDP

where:	c						-	cost function of generation p
L						-	Lambda (Lagrange multiplier)
PD					-	total system load or demand; constant
TL					-	total transmission losses which is a function of p
MXDP,MNDP	-	given dispatch limits

For the solution set of p values, the term (Sum p - PD - TL) is zero and F will be the minimum total cost.

The minimum of F is determined when each first derivative of F with respect to generator i, df/dp(i), is zero.  The solution criterion is met by the simultaneous solution of the following coordination equations:

(dC(1)/dP(1)) * PF(1) = L
(dC(2)/dP(2)) * PF(2) = L
 .
 .
 .
(dC(n)/dP(n)) * PF(n) = L

where:	dC(i)/dP(i)	-	dc/dp, incremental cost c of unit i at generation level P
PF(i)			-	1/(1 - dTL/dP(i))
-	penalty factor as function of the incremental transmission loss for generator i, dTL/dP(i)
L					-	incremental cost at delivered power, Lambda

These equations state that the incremental cost of delivered power is equal for all dispatched resources.  The penalty factor takes into account the cost of transferring the generated power to the load center.  The penalty factors are assembled by the ED data processing function from one of four sets of penalty factors and entered dispatch (multiplier) factors found in the database.

The MW output of each generator is obtained from its incremental cost curve for the iteration lambda.  If the MW value is outside of the unit dispatch limits, the output is held at the appropriate limit.

5.5.2  Additional Features

Additional features enhance the classical Lambda dispatch algorithm.  These features are:

·	fixing and removing resources from iterations

·	Lambda postulate algorithm

The fixing and removing of units from further iterations is performed when the previous iteration does not converge to the solution.  This process consists of recognizing the over- or under-generating state of the previous iteration pass.  At this point, the units are fixed at their high limits in the under-generating state and removed from the iterative loop, since their dispatch levels would not change in further iterations.  Units are fixed at their low limits in the over-generating state in a similar fashion.

In the Lambda algorithm, the composite slope at the previous lambda from units remaining in the iteration loop is applied as part of the first-order Taylor's approximation of lambda:

L(new) = L(prev) + m' * MWERROR

subject to dynamic high and low lambda limits LMAX and LMIN:

LMIN £ L(new) £ LMAX

where:	m'				-	slope of the composite incremental cost curve
L( )				-	lambda postulate
MWERROR	-	the excess of (over-generation) or lack of (under-generation) dispatch MW's
LMAX		-	L(prev) when L(new) will be smaller
LMIN			-	L(prev) when L(new) will be larger
By constraining L within LMAX and LMIN, a diverging solution is prevented.  If the new L fails the limit test, it is not set to the limit but rather is recomputed by bisection:

L(new) = (LMAX + LMIN)/2

5.5.3  Coordination Equations Solution

The solution of the coordination equations proceeds in an iterative fashion.  The major steps in the solution include:

·	postulation of solution lambda L

·	derivation of unit dispatch MW from the ICC for all units

·	decision as to the necessity for another iteration (by comparing total dispatched MW to total desired MW)

·	fixing and removing resources prior to next iteration

Solution lambda L is initialized by observing resource limits.  The incremental cost LMIN associated with the cheapest resource at its minimum limit and the incremental cost LMAX associated with the most expensive resource at its maximum limit are used in the initial guess of L.  When the previous solution is within these limits, its value is used as L(0); otherwise L(0) is computed by bisection as follows:

L(0) = (LMAX + LMIN)/2

Postulation of lambda between iterations utilizes the slope of the composite incremental cost curve at the current guess of lambda:

L(new) = L(prev) + (DMW-Sum p)/INVSLP

where:	L(new)	-	new guess of lambda
L(prev)	-	previous iteration guess of lambda
INVSLP	-	inverse slope of the composite cost curve at L(prev)
= sum (inverse(unit ICC slopes))
DMW		-	total desired dispatch MW
Sum p		-	sum of base points at previous iteration

Resources are dispatched at the current guess for solution lambda.  Each dispatched MW level is constrained by the unit dispatch limits; when the dispatch level is beyond a limit, it is set to that limit.

Upon comparison of DMW and the sum of base points, it can be determined if the current guess of lambda results in too much generation or too little generation.  In certain situations, units can be removed from further calculations.  This technique improves the performance of the solution.  The positive slope characteristic of the unit ICC's allows this assumption.

The following outline illustrates the solution procedure:

1.0	Initialization
1.1	Make initial guess for solution lambda; determine LMAX and LMIN

Description of Economic Dispatch - System Lambda


Duke’s approach to economic dispatch involves the iterative process of evaluating system incremental costs, unit generation levels, and system load requirements.  The theory behind economic dispatch is to operate the generation units at an equal incremental cost (adjusted for transmission losses) to minimize system costs.  The process is conceptually described as follows:
Select a system incremental cost to evaluate based on system load requirements.
Use the selected system incremental cost to calculate unit incremental costs using unit penalty factors.  Unit penalty factors relate unit generation levels to system transmission losses.
Calculate unit generation levels using the unit incremental cost and unit incremental cost curves.
Sum up unit generation levels to get system generation.
Compare system generation to system load requirements.
If system generation is less than system load requirements, select a new system incremental cost that is greater than the previous system incremental cost.  If system generation is greater than system load requirement, select a new system incremental cost that is less than the previous system incremental cost.
Return to step 2 and continue the process.

Once system generation equals the system load requirements (within a small deadband), the economic dispatch process is complete.  The last system incremental cost is system lambda, and the last unit generation levels are the optimal generation levels.",0

233,2009,12,0,100,,"Description of Economic Dispatch

Calculation of System lambda

The goal of economic dispatch is to match electric power resources with electricity demand in near real-time on a least incremental cost basis.  For a given system generation requirement, the cheapest operating point occurs where the incremental power cost (lambda) for each controllable unit is equal.  The mathematical derivation proving the merits of equal lambda dispatch may be found in most power system analysis text books.  The controller must therefore be able to find the right system lambda and the desired generation of each unit at that lambda.

Economic (equal lambda) dispatch at Progress Energy Carolinas is achieved with the use of unit incremental heat rate curves, fuel costs, emissions costs and penalty factors for transmission losses.  The incremental cost curve for each generating unit is the product of the incremental heat rate curve (that considers emissions per MBTU of heat input) multiplied by the unit fuel cost and adjusted by the penalty factor to account for transmission losses.  While attempting to maintain an ACE of zero, thus fulfilling the Balancing Authority function, each unit’s incremental cost curve is set equal to the system incremental cost (lambda) to determine unit output (MW).  As load increases and generation increases to achieve a zero ACE, a new system lambda is selected in order to match generation with load.  An iterative process of selecting lambda and determining unit output until ACE is brought to zero is employed constantly on the Energy Management System.  As load diminishes, generation is reduced to balance resources with demand to achieve a zero ACE.  Here again, a new system lambda is selected and unit incremental cost curves evaluated to match generation with load.

The DAM sets prices as of 11:00 A.M. the previous day (thus the term day-ahead) based on generation and energy transaction bids that were offered in advance to the NYISO.  DAM prices are determined on an hourly basis for each of the state's eleven zones and for the four neighboring areas (New England, Hydro Quebec, Ontario Hydro and PJM).  Typically more than 90% of energy transactions processed by NYISO occur in the DAM.  A software program called Security Constrained Unit Commitment (SCUC) determines the amount of energy expected to be needed within the state for each day.  NYISO will schedule the generating units that can most economically satisfy the energy needed to supply customers' demand and allow a sufficient reserve for contingencies.  The New York Marginal Cost of Energy is the base price that NYISO must pay to obtain the needed energy.  This base price is determined at the NYISO reference bus, so named because it is the reference against which losses, congestion, shift factors, panalty factors and other system mathenatical quantitities arecalculated.  It is physically located at the march 345 kV substation in Marcy, New York.  In transmitting energy across the state, there are additional costs for the electrical losses and sometimes for congestion when transmisisonlines become overloaded.  The DAM zonal Local Based Marginal Prices are determined by adding the marginal cost of energy, the marginal cost of losses and the marginal cost of congestion.

The TID Balancing Authority Lambda is generally dictated by the market conditions.  TID supplies its load using hydro, three gas plants, and purchases.  As is done in most places in the U.S., TID schedules its resources one day in advance.  TID's thermal units are typically constrained by their minimum or maximum capabilities and/or the need to allow for the prudent amount of operating reserve.  In the hourly market, the schedulers adjust purchases or sales to account for changes in loads compared to the forecasted amount.  These transacitons are often for amounts less than 10 MW.  During the hour, the generation levels at TID units are varied to meet the actual minute to minute variations in load.  In addition, the generation resources are adjusted to meet other operating criteria such as required water flows, required reserves, and environmental limitations at units.

More often than not, a significant change in load (a change that would be reflected in our forecasted load for the next clock hour) would result in a change in wholesale purchases or sales.  It would not result in a change in the operating level at our thermal units.

	Balancing Authority Hourly System Lambda

	PGE does not use an economic dispatch algorithm for demand following.  PGE's
	Balancing Authority uses hydroelectric generating units for demand following.  The
	following discussion describes PGE's 2009 Balancing Authority resources and how it
	dispatches them to meet its Balancing Authority demand.

	PGE's Resources

	PGE Balancing Authority resources include:  eight wholly owned hydroelectric generating
	plants, the purchase of the output of four hydroelectric generating plants, two jointly
	owned coal-fired generating plants, two wholly owned combined cycle combustion turbine
	plants, one PURPA contract thermal generating plant, one PURPA contract hydroelectric
	generating plant, three non-PURPA contract hydroelectric generating plants and one 
	non-utility thermal generating plant.

	Dispatch of PGE's Resources
	
	Demand following is accomplished by sending the AGC signal either directly to PGE's
	Round Butte hydroelectric generating plant or to the control center which coordinates the
	operation of PGE's four purchased hydroelectric generating plants.  This control center
	coordinates the operation of several hydroelectric generating plants for the plant owners
	and purchasers.

	The individual units of the remaining seven of PGE's wholly owned and three non-
	PURPA hydroelectric generating plants are typically operated at a fixed hourly generating
	output that is based on river flow, reservoir elevation, unit availability, license constraints
	and the regional coordination of hydroelectric plant operation.

	PGE also commits the individual units of its thermal generating plants based on unit
	availability and energy market conditions.  These plants do not receive an automatic
	generation control (AGC) signal.  The determination of the fixed hourly outputs of these
	thermal generating plants takes into account a number of factors including:  the cost and
	availability of fuel, the availability of PGE's and regional hydroelectric generating plants,
	the energy market and the terms of the joint operating agreements.

	System Lambda
		
	PGE does not calculate a system lambda because demand following is not performed by

ICi = IMCi + IHRi * FCi/EFi

ICi = incremental cost

IMCi = incremental maintenance cost

IHRi = incremental heat rate

FCi = Fuel Cost

EFi = Efficiency Factor

The next sub-function is the Dispatch Solution sub-function.  It calcuates a lambda and economic base points for all units using the Generation Allocation sub-function.  The dispatch for each unit is constrained by the operation limits of the unit.  A total system lambda is calculated from the total of the individual unit lambdas.

Firm-Load Lambda Calculation


The AEP System’s calculation of the firm-load lambda is based on the after-the-fact search for the generating unit that could have theoretically served one MW of additional firm demand, in addition to the actual firm demand.  If more than one generating unit were to be candidates to serve that additional MW, the one with the lowest incremental cost would be the one considered. 

The incremental energy cost, in $/MWh, to raise that unit’s loading by one MW above its actual loading is defined as the AEP System’s firm-load lambda.  Such determination and calculation are carried out on an hourly basis.  

Prior to determining that incremental generating unit and the associated incremental cost, the computer program is coded to take into consideration all appropriate realities and obligations encountered while the AEP System’s generation resources are operating on real-time.  These are:  (i) consideration of each operating generating unit’s seasonal capability, including condition deratings and partial outages, if any; (ii) exclusion of capacity blocks actually allocated to unit-power sales commitments; (iii) exclusion of the Donald C. Cook Nuclear Units Nos. 1 and 2 and conventional hydroelectric units from “incremental” consideration, inasmuch as those units generally operate to their physical and regulatory limits; and (iv) inclusion of the 3% spinning reserve requirement over the firm demand, as mandated by the ECAR Document No. 2.

METHOD OFCALCULATION

The coordination equations to be solved by EDC are:

(CJ* df/dpj + Imj) * PFj = LAMBDA

Where: 	Cj 		=Fuel cost for th jth unit.
	dfj/dpj		=Incremental heat rate for the jth unit.
	IMj		=Incremental maintenance cost for the jth unit.
	PFj		=Penalty Factor for the jth unit.
			  Used to bias entire unit cost.
	LAMBDA		=Incremental cost of supplying power to a hypothetical load center of the area.

In addition to the coordination equations, the following power balance equation must be satisfied:

SUM OF Basepoints of 
               dispatched		=SUM OF		Actual generation of dispatched units (at beginning of dispatch)
              
               generation		+ SUM OF		rate-limited difference between base points and current generation of units on ramp, base load, or base load and regulating

			+DC
Where: DG is normally FACE, but is limited to the maximum MW all units on control may move during the interval between EDC executions.  DC always has the same sign as FACE

The EDC routine consists of an inner and outer loop.  The inner loop is a binary serach routine for solving the coordination equations in order to obtain base points for a fixed value of LAMBDA.

During this solution it is necessary, of course, to recognize the high and low ecomonic limits and the calculated high and low rate limits.  Once the base points have been determined an outer loop calculation is made to see if the power balance equation is satisfied.  If not, LAMBDA is adjusted, the inner loop is then reentered and a new set of base points calculated. 

This proceedure will continue until one of these conditions is met:

1.  Both the coordination equations and the power balance equation are satisfied to within specified tolerances.

2.  Either the coordination equations or the power balance equation does not converse because of numerical or physical problems.  In this case a message is sent to the system console.

Assuming that a valid solution is obtained, the ecomonic participation factors are computed for those units  which are to follow load.  The base points and exonimic participation factors (for the load following units) are then updated for use by the AGC routines.  The ecomonic participation factors for the units which are not load following are set to zero.

Economic participation factors are calculated by assuming that the slope of the LAMBDA versus genration curve is constant over a short range.  The load is increased by a percentage.  DELEDC, and a new dispatch is made.  Ecomonic participation factors for load above thesum of base points are then calculated:

UEPFUPj = (change in unit j generation)/(change in system load)

The load is then decreased to the same percentage below its original value, and a new dispatch is made.  Ecomonic participation factors for the load below the sum of base points are calculated in the same way as the increasing ones.

EDC utilizes the Auto-Ranging Binary Search method.  It operates by dividing the search region into two, deciding which half the desired result is in, dividing that half into two, and so on until a solution is obtained.  Starting with the desired generation DESGEN (=sum of all generatin from telemetry + FACE) and an initial value of LAMBDA (usually the value from the last EDC),the calculation proceeds until the error (MWn-DESGEN) is less than a set fraction of DESGEN.  This fraction, ERRTWP< resides in the database.

The binary search algorithm will always work for the Economic Dispatch Calculation when given a realistic set of conditions.  Discontinuous heat rate curve is also supported.  Discontinuous curves have slopes that are infinite at certain points.

PNM purchases under long term PPA (Prior Purchase Adjustment), the entire output of the Taiban Mesa Wind Farm (204 MWs).  This resource is dispatched as must take.

PNM Palo Verde nuclear generation is the lowest cost PNM generation resource.  It is also very undesirable to curtail Palo Verde nuclear generation from a plant operations perspective.  Therefore, PNM Palo Verde generation is always run at its full capability. 

PNM San Juan generation is typically the next lowest cost PNM generation resource.  That generation is on Automatic Generation Control to follow swings in PNM area control error (ACE).

PNM has a purchase from Southwestern Public Service Co. (SPS) that has an energy price, which varies on a monthly basis.  That energy price is historically above the San Juan and Four Corners incremental energy generation cost.

Valencia is a gas plant located south of Albuquerque.  Its total output is purchased by PNM.  It is started for load, for reserves, for load side used for transmission support, to support conditional firm transmission sales, and for energy sales.  It is typically dispatched after Reeves and before Delta.

Delta-Person is a gas/oil plant located in Albuquerque.  Its total output is purchased by PNM and is dispatched economically, usually after Valencia generation. When on line, Delta-Person is on Automatic Generation Control to follow swings in PNM area control error (ACE).  It is started for load, to support conditional firm transmission sales, or for loadside used for transmission support.  It can also be brought online to recover from a unit trip; in such cases it may be brought online before Reeves or Valencia.

PNM System Lambda Calculation

Since PNM is not able to economically dispatch non-PNM Balancing Authority generation resources, the System Lambda calculation only includes PNM generation resources.  If generation resources having an incremental fuel cost less than the calculated San Juan lambda are being curtailed, the PNM Real Time Power Trader manually schedules the lower cost resource to replace the higher lambda San Juan resource.  The calculated San Juan lambda value is manually replaced with the lower value.  If the PNM San Juan generation resource is fully scheduled, except for unloaded capacity needed for regulation and spinning reserves, and PNM is using generation resources having a higher incremental fuel cost (such as purchased energy with a higher cost than the San Juan lambda), the PNM Real Time Power Trader replaces the previously calculated lambda value with the cost of the next incremental generation resource available to PNM.

Also, OPPD's reported system lambda does not consider the costs of purchases or sales.  When OPPD has loaded its inexpensive coal generation, OPPD may choose to purchase energy, which is more expensive then coal but less expensive than operating a combustion turbine.  OPPD might back down some of its coal resources in order to meet operating reserves and load following obligations, and purchase a block of more expensive energy.

	Part II - Schedule 6.  Balancing Authority Area Description of Economic Dispatch


	
	Balancing Authority Hourly System Lambda

	PGE does not use an economic dispatch algorithm for demand following.  PGE's
	Balancing Authority uses hydroelectric generating units for demand following.  The
	following discussion describes PGE's 2010 Balancing Authority resources and how it
	dispatches them to meet its Balancing Authority demand.

	PGE's Resources

	PGE Balancing Authority resources include:  eight wholly owned hydroelectric generating
	plants, the purchase of the output of four hydroelectric generating plants, two jointly
	owned coal-fired generating plants, two wholly owned combined cycle combustion turbine
	plants, one PURPA contract thermal generating plant, one PURPA contract hydroelectric
	generating plant, three non-PURPA contract hydroelectric generating plants and one 
	non-utility thermal generating plant.

	Dispatch of PGE's Resources

	Demand following is accomplished by sending the AGC signal either directly to PGE's 
	Round Butte hydroelectric generating plant or to the control center which coordinates the
	operation of PGE's four purchased hydroelectric generating plants.  This control center
	coordinates the operation of several hydroelectric generating plants for the plant owners
	and purchasers.

	The individual units of the remaining seven of PGE's wholly owned and three non-
	PURPA hydroelectric generating plants are typically operated at a fixed hourly generating
	output that is based on river flow, reservoir elevation, unit availability, license constraints
	and the regional coordination of hydroelectric plant operation.

	PGE also commits the individual units of its thermal generating plants based on unit
	availability and energy market conditions.  These plants do not receive an automatic
	generation control (AGC), signal.  The determination of the fixed hourly outputs of these
	thermal generating plants takes into account a number of factors including:  the cost and
	availability of fuel, the availability of PGE's and regional hydroelectric generating plants,
	the energy market and the terms of the joint operating agreements.

	System Lambda

	PGE does not calculate a system lambda because demand following is not performed by
	thermal generating units.",0
247,2010,12,0,100,,"Currently, Seattle City Light (Seattle) does not use a classic lambda formula to dispatch its hydroelectric resources to maximum efficiency. The Seattle Energy Management System uses an arbitrarily set water worth value to derive a system lambda which feeds the Economic Dispatch function.  The water worth values are set to essentially place more value on the water of an upstream dam than a downstream dam as the water can be passed through multiple generators. The Economic Dispatch function uses generator performance curves to allocate generation in the most economic manner for those units that are in the economic dispatch mode.  As Seattle’s generators and plants on the Skagit project are not hydraulically matched and there are seasonal flow constraints for fish protection, not all units can be operated in the economic dispatch mode. Seattle normally strives to fully utilize its hydro storage and peaking capability at both its Boundary and Skagit Projects.  During the light load hours, we normally take in lower priced energy into our system, operate our Skagit Project to near minimum license requirements (fish flow minimum), and completely shut down our Boundary Project.  With the exception of the spring run off season, Boundary's entire daily inflow is used to generate only during those sixteen heavy load hours and not the entire day.

The least costly means of obtaining energy is calculated by the Scheduling, Pricing, and Dispatch (SPD) program.  The following limiting factors are utilized by SPD:

116,2010,12,0,100,,"5.5  Economic Allocation - Lambda Dispatch

The Lambda algorithm function determines generator base points and allocates additional reserve to determine new dispatch limits prior to the final base point calculation.

The classical Lambda algorithm solution technique is employed along with additional features that are described below.  The algorithm solution provides a set of generation levels and inverse slopes of the incremental cost curve.  The slope values are later applied for the determination of economic participation factors.

The following notation is used:

P			-	generation MW for a unit being dispatched
Sum p	-	Sum of individual p values being dispatched
DMW	-	total dispatch MW
c			-	generator unit cost curve; c(p) = cost at p output
L			-	Lagrange multiplier whose solution value will be the solution Lambda 

5.5.1  Classical Iterative Approach

The objective of the Lambda algorithm is to find a set of generation p values at minimum total cost for a given desired MW value, DMW:

DMW = SUM p

Since the total cost function is the sum of individual (non-linear) cost functions, the classical Lagrange multiplier method minimizes the augmented cost function F:

F = Sum c(p) + L * (Sum p - PD - TL)

subject to:

MNDP £ p £MXDP

where:	c						-	cost function of generation p
L						-	Lambda (Lagrange multiplier)
PD					-	total system load or demand; constant
TL					-	total transmission losses which is a function of p
MXDP,MNDP	-	given dispatch limits

For the solution set of p values, the term (Sum p - PD - TL) is zero and F will be the minimum total cost.

The minimum of F is determined when each first derivative of F with respect to generator i, df/dp(i), is zero.  The solution criterion is met by the simultaneous solution of the following coordination equations:

(dC(1)/dP(1)) * PF(1) = L
(dC(2)/dP(2)) * PF(2) = L
 .
 .
 .
(dC(n)/dP(n)) * PF(n) = L

where:	dC(i)/dP(i)	-	dc/dp, incremental cost c of unit i at generation level P
PF(i)			-	1/(1 - dTL/dP(i))
-	penalty factor as function of the incremental transmission loss for generator i, dTL/dP(i)
L					-	incremental cost at delivered power, Lambda

These equations state that the incremental cost of delivered power is equal for all dispatched resources.  The penalty factor takes into account the cost of transferring the generated power to the load center.  The penalty factors are assembled by the ED data processing function from one of four sets of penalty factors and entered dispatch (multiplier) factors found in the database.

The MW output of each generator is obtained from its incremental cost curve for the iteration lambda.  If the MW value is outside of the unit dispatch limits, the output is held at the appropriate limit.

5.5.2  Additional Features

Additional features enhance the classical Lambda dispatch algorithm.  These features are:

·	fixing and removing resources from iterations

·	Lambda postulate algorithm

The fixing and removing of units from further iterations is performed when the previous iteration does not converge to the solution.  This process consists of recognizing the over- or under-generating state of the previous iteration pass.  At this point, the units are fixed at their high limits in the under-generating state and removed from the iterative loop, since their dispatch levels would not change in further iterations.  Units are fixed at their low limits in the over-generating state in a similar fashion.

In the Lambda algorithm, the composite slope at the previous lambda from units remaining in the iteration loop is applied as part of the first-order Taylor's approximation of lambda:

L(new) = L(prev) + m' * MWERROR

subject to dynamic high and low lambda limits LMAX and LMIN:

LMIN £ L(new) £ LMAX

where:	m'				-	slope of the composite incremental cost curve
L( )				-	lambda postulate
MWERROR	-	the excess of (over-generation) or lack of (under-generation) dispatch MW's
LMAX		-	L(prev) when L(new) will be smaller
LMIN			-	L(prev) when L(new) will be larger
By constraining L within LMAX and LMIN, a diverging solution is prevented.  If the new L fails the limit test, it is not set to the limit but rather is recomputed by bisection:

L(new) = (LMAX + LMIN)/2

5.5.3  Coordination Equations Solution

The solution of the coordination equations proceeds in an iterative fashion.  The major steps in the solution include:

·	postulation of solution lambda L

·	derivation of unit dispatch MW from the ICC for all units

·	decision as to the necessity for another iteration (by comparing total dispatched MW to total desired MW)

·	fixing and removing resources prior to next iteration

Solution lambda L is initialized by observing resource limits.  The incremental cost LMIN associated with the cheapest resource at its minimum limit and the incremental cost LMAX associated with the most expensive resource at its maximum limit are used in the initial guess of L.  When the previous solution is within these limits, its value is used as L(0); otherwise L(0) is computed by bisection as follows:

L(0) = (LMAX + LMIN)/2

Postulation of lambda between iterations utilizes the slope of the composite incremental cost curve at the current guess of lambda:

L(new) = L(prev) + (DMW-Sum p)/INVSLP

where:	L(new)	-	new guess of lambda
L(prev)	-	previous iteration guess of lambda
INVSLP	-	inverse slope of the composite cost curve at L(prev)
= sum (inverse(unit ICC slopes))
DMW		-	total desired dispatch MW
Sum p		-	sum of base points at previous iteration

Resources are dispatched at the current guess for solution lambda.  Each dispatched MW level is constrained by the unit dispatch limits; when the dispatch level is beyond a limit, it is set to that limit.

Upon comparison of DMW and the sum of base points, it can be determined if the current guess of lambda results in too much generation or too little generation.  In certain situations, units can be removed from further calculations.  This technique improves the performance of the solution.  The positive slope characteristic of the unit ICC's allows this assumption.

The following outline illustrates the solution procedure:

Description of Economic Dispatch

Calculation of System lambda

The goal of economic dispatch is to match electric power resources with electricity demand in near real-time on a least incremental cost basis.  For a given system generation requirement, the cheapest operating point occurs where the incremental power cost (lambda) for each controllable unit is equal.  The mathematical derivation proving the merits of equal lambda dispatch may be found in most power system analysis text books.  The controller must therefore be able to find the right system lambda and the desired generation of each unit at that lambda.

Economic (equal lambda) dispatch at Progress Energy Carolinas is achieved with the use of unit incremental heat rate curves, fuel costs, emissions costs and penalty factors for transmission losses.  The incremental cost curve for each generating unit is the product of the incremental heat rate curve (that considers emissions per MBTU of heat input) multiplied by the unit fuel cost and adjusted by the penalty factor to account for transmission losses.  While attempting to maintain an ACE in compliance with applicable NERC Reliability Standards and such as not to be a burden to the Interconnection, thus fulfilling the Balancing Authority function, each unit’s incremental cost curve is set equal to the system incremental cost (lambda) to determine the desired unit output (MW).  As load increases and generation increases to achieve the desired ACE, a new system lambda is selected in order to match generation with load.  An iterative process of selecting lambda and determining unit output until ACE is achieved within the desired acceptable range is employed constantly on the Energy Management System.  As load diminishes, generation is reduced to balance resources with demand to achieve an ACE in the desired acceptable range.  Here again, a new system lambda is selected and unit incremental cost curves evaluated to match generation with load.

159,2010,12,0,100,,"Economic Dispatch

The Economic Dispatch (ED) function establishes the optimum basepoints for the in-service economically dispatchable thermal generating units in a manner than minimizes the total system production cost, considering the effects of transmission losses, while respecting unit economic and response rate limits.

Significant Features and Benefits

Event triggered ED executions, following relevant changes in power system or generating unit conditions, ensure the timely calculation of optimum basepoints.  Economic participation factors, representing a linear approximation of the ED function, allow adjustment of optimum basepoints to compensate for minor system load changes occurring between ED executions.

The emission constraints of the 1990 Clean Air act can be included in the Economic Dispatch function as an option.

A dual dispatch approach advises the operator of optimum basepoints for selected manually controlled units as well as for automatically controlled units.

Actual and ideal production cost differences reveal system regulation costs and the cost of manually controlled unit operation at nonoptimum basepoints.

Use of real-time penalty factors, derived by security analysis functions (if provided), to account for transmission losses provides the most accurate analysis, ensuring the maximum possible fuel savings.

B-matrix and constant coefficient penalty factor calculation methods account for transmission losses when real-time penalty factors are not available.

Multiple fuel cost and heat rate curve data sets allow modeling of different fuel types and operating conditions for each generating unit.

Technical Overview

Activation Mechanism

The real-time ED function calculates optimum basepoints for the dispatchable thermal generating units on a periodic, operator demand, or event triggered basis.  ED executes periodically when a tunable maximum time period between basepoint calculations, typically five-minutes, has elapsed.  The operator may request execution of the ED function via the CRT displays.  To ensure the most economical system operation, ED also executes as a result of the following events.

The control area load changes significantly since the last basepoint calculation

The control area net interchange changes significantly since the last basepoint calculation

The dispatch status of a generating unit changes

The Automatic Generation Control function, using economic participation factors, adjusts the economic basepoint of a dispatchable generating unit to an economic limit

The operator modifies generating unit fuel cost or heat rate curve data

A tunable minimum time period between basepoint calculations prevents excessive event triggered ED executions.

Economic Basepoint Calculations

ED obtains the most economic system operation when the incremental cost of power delivered to the load is the same for all dispatchable generating units.  Calculation of the unit economic basepoints involves the solution of a set of coordination equations of the following form via a Lagrangian method:

	FCOSTi * dli/dPi;=LAMBDA/PFi

Subject to the constraint equation:

	   n
	?P?= DISPGEN
	   1

where:

	LAMBDA	=  	system incremental cost ($/MW.h)
	FCOSTi	=  	fuel cost for unit ?($/MMBTU)
	dl?/dP?	=  	incremental heat rate for unit i (MMBTU/MW.h)
	PF?        	=  	penalty factor for unit ?
	P?  	=  	economic basepoint for unit ?(MW)
	n  	=  	number of generating units dispatched
	DISPGEN 	= 		total dispatched generation (MW)

A variable number of straight line segments, defined by monotonically increasing ordinates and abscissas, approximate the generating unit incremental heat rate curves.  Multiple fuel cost and incremental heat rate curve data sets, typically six for each generating unit, permit modeling of different fuel types and/or unit operating conditions.  CRT displays allow operator selection of the fuel cost and incremental heat rate curve data set most applicable to the current conditions.  On-line modification for fuel cost and heat rate data allow modeling of current unit conditions.

A study mode dispatch calculates economic basepoints for selected manually controlled units as well as for automatically controlled units.  For the most economic system operation, generating units should operate at basepoints determined from dispatch considering units operating in the AUTOMATIC, ECONOMIC, and MANUAL-DISPATCH control modes.  The results of this dispatch consist of economic basepoints, presented on CRT displays that serve only as operator recommendations.  In this dispatch, unit high and low economic limits constrain the basepoint calculation.

Economic Participation Factors

To accurately reflect actual system economics, the AGC function requires basepoints from a real-time dispatch considering only units operating in the AUTOMATIC and ECONOMIC control mode.  The results of this dispatch consist of economic basepoints and economic participation factors that are input to the AGC desired generation calculation.  The economic participation factors, a linear representation of the incremental cost function for each generating unit operating in the AUTOMATIC control mode, allow adjustment of the economic basepoints to compensate for the minor system load changes that occur between ED executions.

Their use reduces the ED function execution frequency without sacrificing economic operation.  In this dispatch, unit response rate limits as well as high and low economic limits constrain the basepoint calculation.

Penalty Factors

Penalty factors adjust the incremental cost for each generating unit to account for transmission losses incurred due to an incremental change in generation.  The ED function supports three penalty factor calculation methods, real-time, B-Matrix and constant coefficient.  The operator may select, via CRT display, the penalty factor calculation method to be used.

The Penalty Factor Calculation function derives real-time penalty factors using the Jacobian algorithm based on the current power system configuration and condition, as determined by the State Estimation function.  A CRT display presents the real-time penalty factors for each generating unit.

Penalty factors derived from B-matrix and constant coefficient methods account for transmission losses incurred in a specific power system configuration and condition.  The B-matrix penalty factor for a given generating unit is dependent on injections at prespecified power system busses, generally, where generating units, tie-lines and nonconforming loads are connected.  The constant coefficient penalty factor for a given generating unit is linearly proportional to the total system generation.  To provide more accurate assessments using these techniques, ED automatically selects from several sets of B-matrix and constant coefficient data, representing different power system configurations and conditions, based on the system load level.




Emission Dispatch (Option)

The Clean Air Act of 1990 defines a two phased reduction in the emissions of electric generation plants.  From 1995 to 2000, Phase I limits the SO2 emissions of pre-selected generating units.  Phase II becomes effective after the year 2000 and restricts SO2 and NOx emissions for all units over 25 MW.

The emission dispatch calculates generating unit basepoints that minimize the company production cost as well as constraint emissions to hourly emission limits determined by long range planning studies.

Initially, ED performs a dispatch based on generating unit fuel costs and heat rate characteristics.  The pertinent results of this minimum cost dispatch include unit basepoints, system production cost rate and system NOx and SO2 emission rate.  System production cost and emission rates are a summation of individual unit production cost and emission rates, calculated by integration of the incremental heat and emission rate curves to the unit basepoint.

ED performs a second dispatch based on generating unit fuel costs and composite heat and emission rate characteristics.  The composite heat and emission rate characteristics result from a summation of incremental cost curve breakpoints and cost-weighted incremental emission curve breakpoints.  The pertinent results of this dispatch include unit basepoints and system production cost rate and emission rates.

From the results of the two dispatches, ED calculates and emission improvement cost, i.e., the ratio of the increase in production cost to the decrease in emission.  If the emission improvement cost exceeds an operator specified maximum limit, indicating that a reduction in emission is not cost effective, the dispatch solution is complete even if the system emission rates exceed the emission rate limits.  This situation constitutes a recommendation to purchase emission improvement cost is less than an operator specified minimum limit, indicating that a small increase in fuel costs results in significant emission resolutions, ED increases the emission cost weighing factor and the solution continues.

ED compares the system emission rates with NO and SO2 emission rate limits derived from the hourly emission allowances calculated by long term planning functions.  The derived NOx and SO2 emission rate limits consider actual accumulated emissions and expected generation requirement changes.  If the system emission rate exceeds an emission rate limit, ED increases the corresponding emission cost weighing factor and performs another dispatch.  ED repeats the solution process until the system NOx and SO2 emission rates meet the emission rate limits or the emission improvement cost exceeds its limit.

The results of the emission dispatch include the following quantities:

Cost of compliance with emission limits
Optimum generating unit basepoints and participation factors
Expected hourly and instantaneous generating unit and total company emissions (SO2, NOx)
Hourly and instantaneous generating unit and total company fuel usage

Part II - Schedule 6.  Control Area System Lambda Data
Description of Economic Dispatch - System Lambda


Duke’s approach to economic dispatch involves the iterative process of evaluating system incremental costs, unit generation levels, and system load requirements.  The theory behind economic dispatch is to operate the generation units at an equal incremental cost (adjusted for transmission losses) to minimize system costs.  The process is conceptually described as follows:
Select a system incremental cost to evaluate based on system load requirements.
Use the selected system incremental cost to calculate unit incremental costs using unit penalty factors.  Unit penalty factors relate unit generation levels to system transmission losses.
Calculate unit generation levels using the unit incremental cost and unit incremental cost curves.
Sum up unit generation levels to get system generation.
Compare system generation to system load requirements.
If system generation is less than system load requirements, select a new system incremental cost that is greater than the previous system incremental cost.  If system generation is greater than system load requirement, select a new system incremental cost that is less than the previous system incremental cost.
Return to step 2 and continue the process.

Once system generation equals the system load requirements (within a small deadband), the economic dispatch process is complete.  The last system incremental cost is system lambda, and the last unit generation levels are the optimal generation levels.

Typically more than 90% of energy transactions processed by the NYISO occur in the DAM.  A software program called Security Constrained Unit Commitment determines the amount of energy expected to be needed within the state for each day.  The NYISO will schedule the generating units that can most economically satisfy the energy needed to supply customers' demand and allow a sufficient reserve for contingencies.  The New York Marginal Cost of Energy is the base price that the NYISO must pay to obtain the needed energy.  Thsi base price is determined at the NYISO reference bus, so named because it is the reference against which losses, congestion, shift factors, penalty factors and other system mathematical quantities are calculated.  It is physically located at the Marcy 345 kV substation in Marcy, New York.  In transmitting energy across the state, there are additional costs for the electrical losses and sometimes for congestion when transmission lines become overloaded.  The DAM zonal Local Based Marginal Prices are determined by adding the marginal cost of energy, the marginal cost of losses and the marginal cost of congestion.

Economic Dispatch Solution Module (EDSOL)
Given a system total generation requirement, EDSOL determines the most economical generation level for all generators under economic dispatch control, taking into account the generators input-output characteristics, the generators fuel costs and the power losses over the transmission network.
A generating unit's input-output characteristics relate the fuel rate input, MBTU/HR, to the generator's power output (MW). This is usually known as the heat rate curve. The incremental heat rate curve, as the name implies, relates the incremental fuel rate input, MBTU/MWHR, to the generator's power output. Multiplying by the generator's selected fuel's cost, $/MBTU, the generator's incremental cost curve is obtained ($/MWHR vs. MW). The generator's efficiency value (in percent) is also incorporated (by normalization and division) into the determination of the generator's incremental cost curve coefficients. The incremental heat rate curve is linearized and defined by up to eighteen straight- line segments. Each segment is defined by its two end points.
Mathematically, the economic dispatch problem can be expressed as the minimization of the generation cost, which is defined as:
	C = S ci (Pi)						(1)
Where
	C	=	generation cost
	Pi	=	output power of generator i
	ci (Pi)	=	fuel cost for Pi
Subject to the following constraints:
	Pmini £ Pi £ Pmaxi					(2)
	S Pi = Load + Loss (P1. Pi, ...)			(3)
Where
	Pmini	=	minimum power of generator i
	Pmaxi	=	maximum power of generator i
	Load	=	system load
	Loss	=	line losses
Now, consider the augmented Lagrange cost function:
	£ = C - l (S Pi - Load - Loss)				(4)
The optimal solution is given by:
	¶£ = 0
	¶Pi							(5)

i.e.,	¶Ci (Pi)      -      l (1 - ¶ Loss)   = 0
	  ¶ Pi                             ¶ Pi
Which gives the optimal coordination equations:
	l = Pfi    ¶Ci (Pi)						(6)
                                       ¶Pi
Where
	Pfi   =       1      		is the penalty factor of generator i.
                  1 - ¶ Loss
                        ¶ Pi
Equation (6) shows that the optimal dispatch is achieved when all generators operate at equal incremental cost l.
Calculating the penalty factors Pfi, which are a measure of transmission losses, requires the solution of load flow equations.
The Economic Dispatch Solution routine's (EDSOL's) caller normally obtains the penalty factors from the database as calculated by Network Analysis. They can alternately be set by the user or set to unity (1.0).
Any Power Application that provides the appropriate set of input data can utilize EDSOL routine. The caller can optionally direct EDSOL to obtain certain input data, such as generators incremental heat rate curves coefficients and generators fuel selections and costs, directly from the appropriate database tables.
EDSOL begins its processing by adjusting the caller's total required generation to reflect the outputs available from off-control or from base loaded generators. The adjusted value is EDSOL's total required generation from among the economically dispatched generators. In the case of the Economic Dispatch Control (EDC) calling EDSOL, EDSOL develops its total required generation by summing the current actual MW outputs of the economically dispatched generators.
If EDSOL finds that its total required generation can not be satisfied due to being out of range of the EDC High or EDC Low limits sum, then each dispatched generator's desired generation value is set equal to the appropriate EDC limit before returning to the caller. EDSOL also returns the appropriate solution status indication, which the caller can check to detect and possibly act upon (such as by alerting the dispatcher or user) the situation.
EDSOL develops each dispatched generator's incremental cost curve coefficients, as described above, and determines the system's maximum and minimum possible values of Lambda as the initial bounds of the iterative Lambda search.
The set of simultaneous equations described above is solved iteratively by establishing a trial value of Lambda to calculate each dispatched generator's desired power output and the system sum of the desired power outputs. If the system sum of the desired power outputs matches (within a designated tolerance) EDSOL's total required generation, then the iterative Lambda search terminates. Otherwise, the trial value of Lambda is adjusted (using a binary search protected Newton's method adjustment) and another iteration's calculations are performed. The output of the terminated Lambda search is a tentative set of desired output values that are within the generators EDC High and EDC Low limits and will satisfy EDSOL's total required generation.
Each generator's tentative desired output is checked against the generator's designated and calculated disallowed regions. If one or more generator's tentative desired output is found to be within a disallowed region, then one such generator is selected to have its desired output subsequently clamped to the appropriate edge of the disallowed region. With that generator effectively removed from the solution calculations, EDSOL returns to again perform the iterative Lambda search among the reduced set of economically dispatched generators, and then again check for the need to move a generator's desired output value out of a disallowed region.
The disallowed regions check loop is terminated once EDSOL finds that no generator's desired output lies within a disallowed region.
If it is not possible to find a closely matching economic dispatch solution (the designated or calculated disallowed regions cause the economic dispatch solution problem to be excessively constrained), then EDSOL returns the appropriate solution status indication to the caller.
EDSOL returns to the caller the calculated value of Lambda and the set of desired outputs for the economically dispatched generators. Other data is also made available for the caller, such as the solution's status indication (Normal In Range Solution, Constrained By EDC High Limits Sum, etc.), a list of the indices of the economically dispatched generators and the set of calculated (pseudo) disallowed regions to be avoided to limit the starting or stopping of mills.

	Balancing Authority uses hydroelectric generating units for demand following.  The
	following discussion describes PGE's 2011 Balancing Authority resources and how it
	dispatches them to meet its Balancing Authority demand.

	PGE's Resources

	PGE Balancing Authority resources include: seven wholly owned hydroelectric 
	generating plants, the purchase of the output of four hydroelectric generating plants, two
	jointly owned coal-fired generating plants, two wholly owned combined cycle 
	combustion turbine plants, one PURPA contract thermal generating plant, one PURPA
	contract hydroelectric generating plant, three non-PURPA contract hydroelectric
	generating plants and one non-utility thermal generating plant.

	Dispatch of PGE's Resources

	Demand following is accomplished by sending the AGC signal either directly to PGE's
	Round Butte hydroelectric generating plant or to the control center which coordinates the
	operation of PGE's four purchased hydroelectric generating plants.  This control center
	coordinates the operation of several hydroelectric generating plants for the plant owners
	and purchasers.

	The individual units of the remaining seven of PGE's wholly owned and three non-
	PURPA hydroelectric generating plants are typically operated at a fixed hourly
	generating output that is based on river flow, reservoir elevation, unit availability, license
	constraints and the regional coordination of hydroelectric plant operation.

	PGE also commits the individual units of its thermal generating plants based on unit
	availability and energy market conditions.  These plants do not receive an automatic
	generation control (AGC) signal.  The determination of the fixed hourly outputs of these
	thermal generating plants takes into account a number of factors including: the cost and
	availability of fuel, the availability of PGE's and regional hydroelectric generating plants, 
	the energy market and the terms of the joint operating agreements.

	System Lambda

	PGE does not calculate a system lambda because demand following is not performed by
	thermal generating units.

TID's thermal units are typically constrained by their minimum or maximum capabilities and/or the need to allow for the prudent amount of operating reserve.  In the hourly market, the schedulers adjust purchases or sales to account for changes in loads compared to the forecaseted amount.  These transactions are often for amounts less than 10 MW.  During the hour, the generation levels at TID units are varied to meet the actual minute to minute variations in load.  In addition, the generation resouces are adjusted to meet other operating criteria such as required water flows, required reserves, and environmental limitations at units. 

More often than not, a significant change in load (a change that would be reflected in our forecasted load for the next clock hour) would result in a change in wholesale purchases or sales.  It would not result in a change in the opearting level at our thermal units.  For this reason, we have chosen to use the California ISO Hour-Ahead LMP for the NP15 trading hub.

Only units, which are able to respond to load control (Automatic Generation Control, AGC), are included in the Economic Dispatch calculation.

Economic Dispatch Solution Module (EDSOL)
Given a system total generation requirement, EDSOL determines the most economical generation level for all generators under economic dispatch control, taking into account the generators input-output characteristics, the generators fuel costs and the power losses over the transmission network.
A generating unit's input-output characteristics relate the fuel rate input, MBTU/HR, to the generator's power output (MW). This is usually known as the heat rate curve. The incremental heat rate curve, as the name implies, relates the incremental fuel rate input, MBTU/MWHR, to the generator's power output. Multiplying by the generator's selected fuel's cost, $/MBTU, the generator's incremental cost curve is obtained ($/MWHR vs. MW). The generator's efficiency value (in percent) is also incorporated (by normalization and division) into the determination of the generator's incremental cost curve coefficients. The incremental heat rate curve is linearized and defined by up to eighteen straight- line segments. Each segment is defined by its two end points.
Mathematically, the economic dispatch problem can be expressed as the minimization of the generation cost, which is defined as:
	C = S ci (Pi)						(1)
Where
	C	=	generation cost
	Pi	=	output power of generator i
	ci (Pi)	=	fuel cost for Pi
Subject to the following constraints:
	Pmini £ Pi £ Pmaxi					(2)
	S Pi = Load + Loss (P1. Pi, ...)			(3)
Where
	Pmini	=	minimum power of generator i
	Pmaxi	=	maximum power of generator i
	Load	=	system load
	Loss	=	line losses
Now, consider the augmented Lagrange cost function:
	£ = C - l (S Pi - Load - Loss)				(4)
The optimal solution is given by:
	¶£ = 0
	¶Pi							(5)

i.e.,	¶Ci (Pi)      -      l (1 - ¶ Loss)   = 0
	  ¶ Pi                             ¶ Pi
Which gives the optimal coordination equations:
	l = Pfi    ¶Ci (Pi)						(6)
                                       ¶Pi
Where
	Pfi   =       1      		is the penalty factor of generator i.
                  1 - ¶ Loss
                        ¶ Pi
Equation (6) shows that the optimal dispatch is achieved when all generators operate at equal incremental cost l.
Calculating the penalty factors Pfi, which are a measure of transmission losses, requires the solution of load flow equations.
The Economic Dispatch Solution routine's (EDSOL's) caller normally obtains the penalty factors from the database as calculated by Network Analysis. They can alternately be set by the user or set to unity (1.0).
Any Power Application that provides the appropriate set of input data can utilize EDSOL routine. The caller can optionally direct EDSOL to obtain certain input data, such as generators incremental heat rate curves coefficients and generators fuel selections and costs, directly from the appropriate database tables.
EDSOL begins its processing by adjusting the caller's total required generation to reflect the outputs available from off-control or from base loaded generators. The adjusted value is EDSOL's total required generation from among the economically dispatched generators. In the case of the Economic Dispatch Control (EDC) calling EDSOL, EDSOL develops its total required generation by summing the current actual MW outputs of the economically dispatched generators.
If EDSOL finds that its total required generation can not be satisfied due to being out of range of the EDC High or EDC Low limits sum, then each dispatched generator's desired generation value is set equal to the appropriate EDC limit before returning to the caller. EDSOL also returns the appropriate solution status indication, which the caller can check to detect and possibly act upon (such as by alerting the dispatcher or user) the situation.
EDSOL develops each dispatched generator's incremental cost curve coefficients, as described above, and determines the system's maximum and minimum possible values of Lambda as the initial bounds of the iterative Lambda search.
The set of simultaneous equations described above is solved iteratively by establishing a trial value of Lambda to calculate each dispatched generator's desired power output and the system sum of the desired power outputs. If the system sum of the desired power outputs matches (within a designated tolerance) EDSOL's total required generation, then the iterative Lambda search terminates. Otherwise, the trial value of Lambda is adjusted (using a binary search protected Newton's method adjustment) and another iteration's calculations are performed. The output of the terminated Lambda search is a tentative set of desired output values that are within the generators EDC High and EDC Low limits and will satisfy EDSOL's total required generation.
Each generator's tentative desired output is checked against the generator's designated and calculated disallowed regions. If one or more generator's tentative desired output is found to be within a disallowed region, then one such generator is selected to have its desired output subsequently clamped to the appropriate edge of the disallowed region. With that generator effectively removed from the solution calculations, EDSOL returns to again perform the iterative Lambda search among the reduced set of economically dispatched generators, and then again check for the need to move a generator's desired output value out of a disallowed region.
The disallowed regions check loop is terminated once EDSOL finds that no generator's desired output lies within a disallowed region.
If it is not possible to find a closely matching economic dispatch solution (the designated or calculated disallowed regions cause the economic dispatch solution problem to be excessively constrained), then EDSOL returns the appropriate solution status indication to the caller.
EDSOL returns to the caller the calculated value of Lambda and the set of desired outputs for the economically dispatched generators. Other data is also made available for the caller, such as the solution's status indication (Normal In Range Solution, Constrained By EDC High Limits Sum, etc.), a list of the indices of the economically dispatched generators and the set of calculated (pseudo) disallowed regions to be avoided to limit the starting or stopping of mills.

Firm-Load Lambda Calculation


The AEP System’s calculation of the firm-load lambda is based on the after-the-fact search for the generating unit that could have theoretically served one MW of additional firm demand, in addition to the actual firm demand.  If more than one generating unit were to be candidates to serve that additional MW, the one with the lowest incremental cost would be the one considered.

The Economic Dispatch (ED) function establishes the optimum basepoints for the in-service economically dispatchable thermal generating units in a manner than minimizes the total system production cost, considering the effects of transmission losses, while respecting unit economic and response rate limits.

Significant Features and Benefits

Event triggered ED executions, following relevant changes in power system or generating unit conditions, ensure the timely calculation of optimum basepoints.  Economic participation factors, representing a linear approximation of the ED function, allow adjustment of optimum basepoints to compensate for minor system load changes occurring between ED executions.

The emission constraints of the 1990 Clean Air act can be included in the Economic Dispatch function as an option.

A dual dispatch approach advises the operator of optimum basepoints for selected manually controlled units as well as for automatically controlled units.

Actual and ideal production cost differences reveal system regulation costs and the cost of manually controlled unit operation at nonoptimum basepoints.

Use of real-time penalty factors, derived by security analysis functions (if provided), to account for transmission losses provides the most accurate analysis, ensuring the maximum possible fuel savings.

B-matrix and constant coefficient penalty factor calculation methods account for transmission losses when real-time penalty factors are not available.

Multiple fuel cost and heat rate curve data sets allow modeling of different fuel types and operating conditions for each generating unit.

Technical Overview

Activation Mechanism

The real-time ED function calculates optimum basepoints for the dispatchable thermal generating units on a periodic, operator demand, or event triggered basis.  ED executes periodically when a tunable maximum time period between basepoint calculations, typically five-minutes, has elapsed.  The operator may request execution of the ED function via the CRT displays.  To ensure the most economical system operation, ED also executes as a result of the following events.

The control area load changes significantly since the last basepoint calculation

The control area net interchange changes significantly since the last basepoint calculation

The dispatch status of a generating unit changes

The Automatic Generation Control function, using economic participation factors, adjusts the economic basepoint of a dispatchable generating unit to an economic limit

The operator modifies generating unit fuel cost or heat rate curve data

A tunable minimum time period between basepoint calculations prevents excessive event triggered ED executions.

Economic Basepoint Calculations

ED obtains the most economic system operation when the incremental cost of power delivered to the load is the same for all dispatchable generating units.  Calculation of the unit economic basepoints involves the solution of a set of coordination equations of the following form via a Lagrangian method:

	FCOSTi * dli/dPi;=LAMBDA/PFi

Subject to the constraint equation:

	   n
	?P?= DISPGEN
	   1

where:

	LAMBDA	=  	system incremental cost ($/MW.h)
	FCOSTi	=  	fuel cost for unit ?($/MMBTU)
	dl?/dP?	=  	incremental heat rate for unit i (MMBTU/MW.h)
	PF?        	=  	penalty factor for unit ?
	P?  	=  	economic basepoint for unit ?(MW)
	n  	=  	number of generating units dispatched
	DISPGEN 	= 		total dispatched generation (MW)

A variable number of straight line segments, defined by monotonically increasing ordinates and abscissas, approximate the generating unit incremental heat rate curves.  Multiple fuel cost and incremental heat rate curve data sets, typically six for each generating unit, permit modeling of different fuel types and/or unit operating conditions.  CRT displays allow operator selection of the fuel cost and incremental heat rate curve data set most applicable to the current conditions.  On-line modification for fuel cost and heat rate data allow modeling of current unit conditions.

A study mode dispatch calculates economic basepoints for selected manually controlled units as well as for automatically controlled units.  For the most economic system operation, generating units should operate at basepoints determined from dispatch considering units operating in the AUTOMATIC, ECONOMIC, and MANUAL-DISPATCH control modes.  The results of this dispatch consist of economic basepoints, presented on CRT displays that serve only as operator recommendations.  In this dispatch, unit high and low economic limits constrain the basepoint calculation.

Economic Participation Factors

To accurately reflect actual system economics, the AGC function requires basepoints from a real-time dispatch considering only units operating in the AUTOMATIC and ECONOMIC control mode.  The results of this dispatch consist of economic basepoints and economic participation factors that are input to the AGC desired generation calculation.  The economic participation factors, a linear representation of the incremental cost function for each generating unit operating in the AUTOMATIC control mode, allow adjustment of the economic basepoints to compensate for the minor system load changes that occur between ED executions.

Their use reduces the ED function execution frequency without sacrificing economic operation.  In this dispatch, unit response rate limits as well as high and low economic limits constrain the basepoint calculation.

Penalty Factors

Penalty factors adjust the incremental cost for each generating unit to account for transmission losses incurred due to an incremental change in generation.  The ED function supports three penalty factor calculation methods, real-time, B-Matrix and constant coefficient.  The operator may select, via CRT display, the penalty factor calculation method to be used.

The Penalty Factor Calculation function derives real-time penalty factors using the Jacobian algorithm based on the current power system configuration and condition, as determined by the State Estimation function.  A CRT display presents the real-time penalty factors for each generating unit.

Penalty factors derived from B-matrix and constant coefficient methods account for transmission losses incurred in a specific power system configuration and condition.  The B-matrix penalty factor for a given generating unit is dependent on injections at prespecified power system busses, generally, where generating units, tie-lines and nonconforming loads are connected.  The constant coefficient penalty factor for a given generating unit is linearly proportional to the total system generation.  To provide more accurate assessments using these techniques, ED automatically selects from several sets of B-matrix and constant coefficient data, representing different power system configurations and conditions, based on the system load level.




Emission Dispatch (Option)

The Clean Air Act of 1990 defines a two phased reduction in the emissions of electric generation plants.  From 1995 to 2000, Phase I limits the SO2 emissions of pre-selected generating units.  Phase II becomes effective after the year 2000 and restricts SO2 and NOx emissions for all units over 25 MW.

The emission dispatch calculates generating unit basepoints that minimize the company production cost as well as constraint emissions to hourly emission limits determined by long range planning studies.

Initially, ED performs a dispatch based on generating unit fuel costs and heat rate characteristics.  The pertinent results of this minimum cost dispatch include unit basepoints, system production cost rate and system NOx and SO2 emission rate.  System production cost and emission rates are a summation of individual unit production cost and emission rates, calculated by integration of the incremental heat and emission rate curves to the unit basepoint.

ED performs a second dispatch based on generating unit fuel costs and composite heat and emission rate characteristics.  The composite heat and emission rate characteristics result from a summation of incremental cost curve breakpoints and cost-weighted incremental emission curve breakpoints.  The pertinent results of this dispatch include unit basepoints and system production cost rate and emission rates.

From the results of the two dispatches, ED calculates and emission improvement cost, i.e., the ratio of the increase in production cost to the decrease in emission.  If the emission improvement cost exceeds an operator specified maximum limit, indicating that a reduction in emission is not cost effective, the dispatch solution is complete even if the system emission rates exceed the emission rate limits.  This situation constitutes a recommendation to purchase emission improvement cost is less than an operator specified minimum limit, indicating that a small increase in fuel costs results in significant emission resolutions, ED increases the emission cost weighing factor and the solution continues.

ED compares the system emission rates with NO and SO2 emission rate limits derived from the hourly emission allowances calculated by long term planning functions.  The derived NOx and SO2 emission rate limits consider actual accumulated emissions and expected generation requirement changes.  If the system emission rate exceeds an emission rate limit, ED increases the corresponding emission cost weighing factor and performs another dispatch.  ED repeats the solution process until the system NOx and SO2 emission rates meet the emission rate limits or the emission improvement cost exceeds its limit.

The results of the emission dispatch include the following quantities:

Cost of compliance with emission limits
Optimum generating unit basepoints and participation factors
Expected hourly and instantaneous generating unit and total company emissions (SO2, NOx)
Hourly and instantaneous generating unit and total company fuel usage

116,2011,12,0,100,,"5.5  Economic Allocation - Lambda Dispatch

The Lambda algorithm function determines generator base points and allocates additional reserve to determine new dispatch limits prior to the final base point calculation.

The classical Lambda algorithm solution technique is employed along with additional features that are described below.  The algorithm solution provides a set of generation levels and inverse slopes of the incremental cost curve.  The slope values are later applied for the determination of economic participation factors.

The following notation is used:

P			-	generation MW for a unit being dispatched
Sum p	-	Sum of individual p values being dispatched
DMW	-	total dispatch MW
c			-	generator unit cost curve; c(p) = cost at p output
L			-	Lagrange multiplier whose solution value will be the solution Lambda 

5.5.1  Classical Iterative Approach

The objective of the Lambda algorithm is to find a set of generation p values at minimum total cost for a given desired MW value, DMW:

DMW = SUM p

Since the total cost function is the sum of individual (non-linear) cost functions, the classical Lagrange multiplier method minimizes the augmented cost function F:

F = Sum c(p) + L * (Sum p - PD - TL)

subject to:

MNDP £ p £MXDP

where:	c						-	cost function of generation p
L						-	Lambda (Lagrange multiplier)
PD					-	total system load or demand; constant
TL					-	total transmission losses which is a function of p
MXDP,MNDP	-	given dispatch limits

For the solution set of p values, the term (Sum p - PD - TL) is zero and F will be the minimum total cost.

The minimum of F is determined when each first derivative of F with respect to generator i, df/dp(i), is zero.  The solution criterion is met by the simultaneous solution of the following coordination equations:

(dC(1)/dP(1)) * PF(1) = L
(dC(2)/dP(2)) * PF(2) = L
 .
 .
 .
(dC(n)/dP(n)) * PF(n) = L

where:	dC(i)/dP(i)	-	dc/dp, incremental cost c of unit i at generation level P
PF(i)			-	1/(1 - dTL/dP(i))
-	penalty factor as function of the incremental transmission loss for generator i, dTL/dP(i)
L					-	incremental cost at delivered power, Lambda

These equations state that the incremental cost of delivered power is equal for all dispatched resources.  The penalty factor takes into account the cost of transferring the generated power to the load center.  The penalty factors are assembled by the ED data processing function from one of four sets of penalty factors and entered dispatch (multiplier) factors found in the database.

The MW output of each generator is obtained from its incremental cost curve for the iteration lambda.  If the MW value is outside of the unit dispatch limits, the output is held at the appropriate limit.

5.5.2  Additional Features

Additional features enhance the classical Lambda dispatch algorithm.  These features are:

·	fixing and removing resources from iterations

·	Lambda postulate algorithm

The fixing and removing of units from further iterations is performed when the previous iteration does not converge to the solution.  This process consists of recognizing the over- or under-generating state of the previous iteration pass.  At this point, the units are fixed at their high limits in the under-generating state and removed from the iterative loop, since their dispatch levels would not change in further iterations.  Units are fixed at their low limits in the over-generating state in a similar fashion.

In the Lambda algorithm, the composite slope at the previous lambda from units remaining in the iteration loop is applied as part of the first-order Taylor's approximation of lambda:

L(new) = L(prev) + m' * MWERROR

subject to dynamic high and low lambda limits LMAX and LMIN:

LMIN £ L(new) £ LMAX

where:	m'				-	slope of the composite incremental cost curve
L( )				-	lambda postulate
MWERROR	-	the excess of (over-generation) or lack of (under-generation) dispatch MW's
LMAX		-	L(prev) when L(new) will be smaller
LMIN			-	L(prev) when L(new) will be larger
By constraining L within LMAX and LMIN, a diverging solution is prevented.  If the new L fails the limit test, it is not set to the limit but rather is recomputed by bisection:

L(new) = (LMAX + LMIN)/2

5.5.3  Coordination Equations Solution

The solution of the coordination equations proceeds in an iterative fashion.  The major steps in the solution include:

·	postulation of solution lambda L

·	derivation of unit dispatch MW from the ICC for all units

·	decision as to the necessity for another iteration (by comparing total dispatched MW to total desired MW)

·	fixing and removing resources prior to next iteration

Solution lambda L is initialized by observing resource limits.  The incremental cost LMIN associated with the cheapest resource at its minimum limit and the incremental cost LMAX associated with the most expensive resource at its maximum limit are used in the initial guess of L.  When the previous solution is within these limits, its value is used as L(0); otherwise L(0) is computed by bisection as follows:

L(0) = (LMAX + LMIN)/2

Postulation of lambda between iterations utilizes the slope of the composite incremental cost curve at the current guess of lambda:

L(new) = L(prev) + (DMW-Sum p)/INVSLP

where:	L(new)	-	new guess of lambda
L(prev)	-	previous iteration guess of lambda
INVSLP	-	inverse slope of the composite cost curve at L(prev)
= sum (inverse(unit ICC slopes))
DMW		-	total desired dispatch MW
Sum p		-	sum of base points at previous iteration

Resources are dispatched at the current guess for solution lambda.  Each dispatched MW level is constrained by the unit dispatch limits; when the dispatch level is beyond a limit, it is set to that limit.

Upon comparison of DMW and the sum of base points, it can be determined if the current guess of lambda results in too much generation or too little generation.  In certain situations, units can be removed from further calculations.  This technique improves the performance of the solution.  The positive slope characteristic of the unit ICC's allows this assumption.

The following outline illustrates the solution procedure:

233,2011,12,0,100,,"Calculation of System lambda

The goal of economic dispatch is to match electric power resources with electricity demand in near real-time on a least incremental cost basis.  For a given system generation requirement, the cheapest operating point occurs where the incremental power cost (lambda) for each controllable unit is equal.  The mathematical derivation proving the merits of equal lambda dispatch may be found in most power system analysis text books.  The controller must therefore be able to find the right system lambda and the desired generation of each unit at that lambda.

Economic (equal lambda) dispatch at Progress Energy Carolinas is achieved with the use of unit incremental heat rate curves, fuel costs, emissions costs and penalty factors for transmission losses.  The incremental cost curve for each generating unit is the product of the incremental heat rate curve (that considers emissions per MBTU of heat input) multiplied by the unit fuel cost and adjusted by the penalty factor to account for transmission losses.  While attempting to maintain an ACE in compliance with applicable NERC Reliability Standards and such as not to be a burden to the Interconnection, thus fulfilling the Balancing Authority function, each unit’s incremental cost curve is set equal to the system incremental cost (lambda) to determine the desired unit output (MW).  As load increases and generation increases to achieve the desired ACE, a new system lambda is selected in order to match generation with load.  An iterative process of selecting lambda and determining unit output until ACE is achieved within the desired acceptable range is employed constantly on the Energy Management System.  As load diminishes, generation is reduced to balance resources with demand to achieve an ACE in the desired acceptable range.  Here again, a new system lambda is selected and unit incremental cost curves evaluated to match generation with load.

The DAM sets prices as of 11:00 AM the previous day (thus the term day-ahead) based on generation and energy transaction bids that were offered in advance to the New York Independent System Operator (""NYISO"").  DAM prices are determined on an hourly bases for each of the state's eleven zones and for the four neighboring area (New England, Hydro Quebec, Ontario Hydro and PJM).  Typically more that 90% of energy transactions processed by NYISO occur in the DAM.  A software program called Security Constrained Unit Commitment (""SCUC"") determines the amount of energy expected to be needed within the state for each day.  NYISO will schedule the generating units that can most economically satisfy the energy needed to supply customers' demand and allow a sufficient reserve for contingencies.  The New York Marginal Cost of Energy is the base price that NYISO must pay to obtain the needed energy.  This base price is determined at the NYISO reference bus, so named because it is the reference against which losses, congestion, shift factors, penalty factors and other system mathematical quantities are calculated.  It is physically located at the March 345 kV substation in Marcy, NewYork.  In transmitting energy across the state, there are additional costs for the electric losses and sometimes for congestion when transmission lines become overloaded.  The DAM zonal Local Based Marginal Prices are determined by adding the marginal cost of energy, the marginal cost of losses and the marginal cost of congestion.

Since there are no agreements for PNM economic dispatch of non-PNM generation resources within the PNM Balancing Authority, each utility within the PNM Balancing Authority independently performs economic dispatch of their own generation resources.  The majority of PNM Balancing Authority generation resources belong to PNM.  PNM generation resources are economically dispatched as follows:

PNM purchases under long term PPA (Prior Purchase Adjustment), the entire output of the Taiban Mesa Wind Farm (204 MWs).  This resource is dispatched as must take.

PNM Palo Verde nuclear generation is the lowest cost PNM generation resource.  It is also very undesirable to curtail Palo Verde nuclear generation from a plant operations perspective.  Therefore, PNM Palo Verde generation is always run at its full capability. 

PNM San Juan generation is typically the next lowest cost PNM generation resource.  That generation is on Automatic Generation Control to follow swings in PNM area control error (ACE).   PNM ownership of San Juan units is spread over four units.  PNM's Energy Management System (EMS) is equipped with an economic dispatch function.  

PNM Four Corners generation is usually PNM's next resource in the dispatch stack.  It does not provide AGC, it is typically fully loaded, except when the spot market is lower than the Four Corners incremental cost.    

PNM owns one third of the Luna Energy Facility.  This is a two on one combined cycle gas unit with an optimum heat rate of 7200.  This Luna unit is on Automatic Generation Control (AGC) and is dispatched in economic basis after the SPS contract.

PNM owns 100% of the Afton Power Plant.  This plant is a one on one combined cycle gas plant with an optimum heat rate of 7200.

Lordsburg Generating Station is a gas only turbine located in southern New Mexico, owned and operated by PNM.  It is started for load, regulation or for spinning reserves resources, provided transmission is purchased to the delivery point, and for energy sales, if its operating costs are within the range of spot market costs.

PNM Reeves is a gas plant located in Albuquerque.  It is started for load, for spinning reserves resources, for loadside used for transmission support, for conditional firm transmission sales, and for energy sales, if its operating costs are within the range of spot market costs.

Valencia is a gas plant located south of Albuquerque.  Its total output is purchased by PNM.  It is started for load, for reserves, for load side used for transmission support, to support conditional firm transmission sales, and for energy sales.  It is typically dispatched after Reeves and before Delta.  However, Valencia can come online much more quickly than Reeves, so in the event of a unit trip, Valencia may be brought online instead of Reeves.  

Delta-Person is a gas/oil plant located in Albuquerque.  Its total output is purchased by PNM and is dispatched economically, usually after Valencia generation. When on line, Delta-Person is on Automatic Generation Control to follow swings in PNM area control error (ACE).  It is started for load, to support conditional firm transmission sales, or for loadside used for transmission support.  It can also be brought online to recover from a unit trip; in such cases it may be brought online before Reeves or Valencia. 

In 2011, 22 MWs of Solar generation were added to PNM’s renewable generation portfolio.  The Facilities are geographically dispersed throughout PNM’s Balancing Authority area.  While these resources are not economically dispatched, they are included in daily unit commitments.

PNM System Lambda Calculation

Since PNM is not able to economically dispatch non-PNM Balancing Authority generation resources, the System Lambda calculation only includes PNM generation resources.  If generation resources having an incremental fuel cost less than the calculated San Juan lambda are being curtailed, the PNM Real Time Power Trader manually schedules the lower cost resource to replace the higher lambda San Juan resource.  The calculated San Juan lambda value is manually replaced with the lower value.  If the PNM San Juan generation resource is fully scheduled, except for unloaded capacity needed for regulation and spinning reserves, and PNM is using generation resources having a higher incremental fuel cost (such as purchased energy with a higher cost than the San Juan lambda), the PNM Real Time Power Trader replaces the previously calculated lambda value with the cost of the next incremental generation resource available to PNM.

Description of Economic Dispatch - System Lambda


Duke’s approach to economic dispatch involves the iterative process of evaluating system incremental costs, unit generation levels, and system load requirements.  The theory behind economic dispatch is to operate the generation units at an equal incremental cost (adjusted for transmission losses) to minimize system costs.  The process is conceptually described as follows:
Select a system incremental cost to evaluate based on system load requirements.
Use the selected system incremental cost to calculate unit incremental costs using unit penalty factors.  Unit penalty factors relate unit generation levels to system transmission losses.
Calculate unit generation levels using the unit incremental cost and unit incremental cost curves.
Sum up unit generation levels to get system generation.
Compare system generation to system load requirements.
If system generation is less than system load requirements, select a new system incremental cost that is greater than the previous system incremental cost.  If system generation is greater than system load requirement, select a new system incremental cost that is less than the previous system incremental cost.
Return to step 2 and continue the process.

Once system generation equals the system load requirements (within a small deadband), the economic dispatch process is complete.  The last system incremental cost is system lambda, and the last unit generation levels are the optimal generation levels.

We have 47 hydro units located at 18 plants, and shares of 7 coal-fired thermal units at 3 plants. Idaho Power also has 4 natural gas-fired simple cycle combustion units at 2 plants.
Our thermal resources are dispatched on a monthly or weekly basis, depending upon the season. They are typically base-loaded, providing energy to the system. This thermal energy is then shaped with our controllable hydro-electric generating units. These hydro resources provide essentially our entire load following, and as such, we do not calculate an hourly system lambda.
At the present time, Idaho Power’s computerized economic dispatch function is limited to dispatching hydro units to utilize the maximum amount of water at each plant. Cost information is not a factor in this determination. Load frequency control is performed primarily with generators at only two of our large hydro projects. The balance of our hydro projects are usually operated as either run-of-river or re-regulating plants.

		Note on Method of System lambda:

		The system lambda value is calculated by the Economic Dispatch function every two
		minutes or on user demand with a maximum request frequency of four seconds.  The

		subject to the system power balance constraint using a LaGrande multiplier method.
		The system lambda is a value of the LaGrange multiplier when the system fuel total
		is minimum.",0
133,2011,12,0,100,,"METHOD OFCALCULATION

The coordination equations to be solved by EDC are:

(CJ* df/dpj + Imj) * PFj = LAMBDA

Where: 	Cj 		=Fuel cost for th jth unit.
	dfj/dpj		=Incremental heat rate for the jth unit.
	IMj		=Incremental maintenance cost for the jth unit.
	PFj		=Penalty Factor for the jth unit.
			  Used to bias entire unit cost.
	LAMBDA		=Incremental cost of supplying power to a hypothetical load center of the area.

In addition to the coordination equations, the following power balance equation must be satisfied:

SUM OF Basepoints of 
               dispatched		=SUM OF		Actual generation of dispatched units (at beginning of dispatch)
              
               generation		+ SUM OF		rate-limited difference between base points and current generation of units on ramp, base load, or base load and regulating

			+DC
Where: DG is normally FACE, but is limited to the maximum MW all units on control may move during the interval between EDC executions.  DC always has the same sign as FACE

The EDC routine consists of an inner and outer loop.  The inner loop is a binary serach routine for solving the coordination equations in order to obtain base points for a fixed value of LAMBDA.

During this solution it is necessary, of course, to recognize the high and low ecomonic limits and the calculated high and low rate limits.  Once the base points have been determined an outer loop calculation is made to see if the power balance equation is satisfied.  If not, LAMBDA is adjusted, the inner loop is then reentered and a new set of base points calculated. 

This proceedure will continue until one of these conditions is met:

1.  Both the coordination equations and the power balance equation are satisfied to within specified tolerances.

2.  Either the coordination equations or the power balance equation does not converse because of numerical or physical problems.  In this case a message is sent to the system console.

Assuming that a valid solution is obtained, the ecomonic participation factors are computed for those units  which are to follow load.  The base points and exonimic participation factors (for the load following units) are then updated for use by the AGC routines.  The ecomonic participation factors for the units which are not load following are set to zero.

Economic participation factors are calculated by assuming that the slope of the LAMBDA versus genration curve is constant over a short range.  The load is increased by a percentage.  DELEDC, and a new dispatch is made.  Ecomonic participation factors for load above thesum of base points are then calculated:

UEPFUPj = (change in unit j generation)/(change in system load)

The load is then decreased to the same percentage below its original value, and a new dispatch is made.  Ecomonic participation factors for the load below the sum of base points are calculated in the same way as the increasing ones.

EDC utilizes the Auto-Ranging Binary Search method.  It operates by dividing the search region into two, deciding which half the desired result is in, dividing that half into two, and so on until a solution is obtained.  Starting with the desired generation DESGEN (=sum of all generatin from telemetry + FACE) and an initial value of LAMBDA (usually the value from the last EDC),the calculation proceeds until the error (MWn-DESGEN) is less than a set fraction of DESGEN.  This fraction, ERRTWP< resides in the database.

The binary search algorithm will always work for the Economic Dispatch Calculation when given a realistic set of conditions.  Discontinuous heat rate curve is also supported.  Discontinuous curves have slopes that are infinite at certain points.

170,2012,12,0,100,,"Economic Dispatch Solution Module (EDSOL)
Given a system total generation requirement, EDSOL determines the most economical generation level for all generators under economic dispatch control, taking into account the generators input-output characteristics, the generators fuel costs and the power losses over the transmission network.
A generating unit's input-output characteristics relate the fuel rate input, MBTU/HR, to the generator's power output (MW). This is usually known as the heat rate curve. The incremental heat rate curve, as the name implies, relates the incremental fuel rate input, MBTU/MWHR, to the generator's power output. Multiplying by the generator's selected fuel's cost, $/MBTU, the generator's incremental cost curve is obtained ($/MWHR vs. MW). The generator's efficiency value (in percent) is also incorporated (by normalization and division) into the determination of the generator's incremental cost curve coefficients. The incremental heat rate curve is linearized and defined by up to eighteen straight- line segments. Each segment is defined by its two end points.
Mathematically, the economic dispatch problem can be expressed as the minimization of the generation cost, which is defined as:
	C = S ci (Pi)						(1)
Where
	C	=	generation cost
	Pi	=	output power of generator i
	ci (Pi)	=	fuel cost for Pi
Subject to the following constraints:
	Pmini £ Pi £ Pmaxi					(2)
	S Pi = Load + Loss (P1. Pi, ...)			(3)
Where
	Pmini	=	minimum power of generator i
	Pmaxi	=	maximum power of generator i
	Load	=	system load
	Loss	=	line losses
Now, consider the augmented Lagrange cost function:
	£ = C - l (S Pi - Load - Loss)				(4)
The optimal solution is given by:
	¶£ = 0
	¶Pi							(5)

i.e.,	¶Ci (Pi)      -      l (1 - ¶ Loss)   = 0
	  ¶ Pi                             ¶ Pi
Which gives the optimal coordination equations:
	l = Pfi    ¶Ci (Pi)						(6)
                                       ¶Pi
Where
	Pfi   =       1      		is the penalty factor of generator i.
                  1 - ¶ Loss
                        ¶ Pi
Equation (6) shows that the optimal dispatch is achieved when all generators operate at equal incremental cost l.
Calculating the penalty factors Pfi, which are a measure of transmission losses, requires the solution of load flow equations.
The Economic Dispatch Solution routine's (EDSOL's) caller normally obtains the penalty factors from the database as calculated by Network Analysis. They can alternately be set by the user or set to unity (1.0).
Any Power Application that provides the appropriate set of input data can utilize EDSOL routine. The caller can optionally direct EDSOL to obtain certain input data, such as generators incremental heat rate curves coefficients and generators fuel selections and costs, directly from the appropriate database tables.
EDSOL begins its processing by adjusting the caller's total required generation to reflect the outputs available from off-control or from base loaded generators. The adjusted value is EDSOL's total required generation from among the economically dispatched generators. In the case of the Economic Dispatch Control (EDC) calling EDSOL, EDSOL develops its total required generation by summing the current actual MW outputs of the economically dispatched generators.
If EDSOL finds that its total required generation can not be satisfied due to being out of range of the EDC High or EDC Low limits sum, then each dispatched generator's desired generation value is set equal to the appropriate EDC limit before returning to the caller. EDSOL also returns the appropriate solution status indication, which the caller can check to detect and possibly act upon (such as by alerting the dispatcher or user) the situation.
EDSOL develops each dispatched generator's incremental cost curve coefficients, as described above, and determines the system's maximum and minimum possible values of Lambda as the initial bounds of the iterative Lambda search.
The set of simultaneous equations described above is solved iteratively by establishing a trial value of Lambda to calculate each dispatched generator's desired power output and the system sum of the desired power outputs. If the system sum of the desired power outputs matches (within a designated tolerance) EDSOL's total required generation, then the iterative Lambda search terminates. Otherwise, the trial value of Lambda is adjusted (using a binary search protected Newton's method adjustment) and another iteration's calculations are performed. The output of the terminated Lambda search is a tentative set of desired output values that are within the generators EDC High and EDC Low limits and will satisfy EDSOL's total required generation.
Each generator's tentative desired output is checked against the generator's designated and calculated disallowed regions. If one or more generator's tentative desired output is found to be within a disallowed region, then one such generator is selected to have its desired output subsequently clamped to the appropriate edge of the disallowed region. With that generator effectively removed from the solution calculations, EDSOL returns to again perform the iterative Lambda search among the reduced set of economically dispatched generators, and then again check for the need to move a generator's desired output value out of a disallowed region.
The disallowed regions check loop is terminated once EDSOL finds that no generator's desired output lies within a disallowed region.
If it is not possible to find a closely matching economic dispatch solution (the designated or calculated disallowed regions cause the economic dispatch solution problem to be excessively constrained), then EDSOL returns the appropriate solution status indication to the caller.
EDSOL returns to the caller the calculated value of Lambda and the set of desired outputs for the economically dispatched generators. Other data is also made available for the caller, such as the solution's status indication (Normal In Range Solution, Constrained By EDC High Limits Sum, etc.), a list of the indices of the economically dispatched generators and the set of calculated (pseudo) disallowed regions to be avoided to limit the starting or stopping of mills.

The TID Balancing Authority Lambda is generally dictated by the market conditions.  TID supplies its load using hydro, three gas plants, wind and purchases.  As is done in most places in the U.S., TID schedules its resources one day in advance.  TID's thermal units are typically constrained by their minimum or maximum capabilities and/or the need to allow for the prudent amount of operating reserve.  In the hourly market, the schedulers adjust purchases or sales to account for changes in loads compared to the forecasted amount.  These transactions are often for amounts less than 10 MW.  During the hour, the generation levels at TID units are varied to meet the actual minute to minute variations in load.  In addition, the generation resources are adjusted to meet other operating criteria such as required water flows, required reserves, and environmental limitations at units.

More often than not, a significant change in load (a change that would be reflected in our forecasted load for the next clock hour) would result in a change in wholesale purchases or sales.  It would not result in a change in the operating level at our thermal units.  For this reason, we have chosen to use the California ISO Hour-Ahead LMP for the NP15 trading hub.

	Balancing Authority Hourly System Lambda
	
	PGE does not use an economic dispatch algorithm for demand following.  PGE's
	Balancing Authority uses hydroelectric generating units for demand following.  The
	following discussion describes PGE's 2012 Balancing Authority resources and how it 
	dispatches them to meet its Balancing Authority demand.

	PGE's Resources

	PGE Balancing Authority resources include: seven wholly owned hydroelectric
	generating plants, the purchase of the output of four hydroelectric generating plants, two
	jointly owned coal-fired generating plants, two wholly owned combined cycle 
	combustion turbine plants, one PURPA contract thermal generating plant, one PURPA 
	contract hydroelectric generating plant, three non-PURPA contract hydroelectric
	generating plants and one non-utility thermal generating plant.

	Dispatch of PGE's Resources

	Demand following is accomplished by sending the AGC signal either directly to PGE's 
	Round Butte hydroelectric generating plant or to the control center which coordinates the
	operation of PGE's four purchased hydroelectric generating plants.  This control center
	coordinates the operation of several hydroelectric generating plants for the plant owners
	and purchasers.

	The individual units of the remaining seven of PGE's wholly owned and three non-
	PURPA hydroelectric generating plants are typically operated at a fixed hourly
	generating output that is based on river flow, reservoir elevation, unit availability, license
	constraints and the regional coordination of hydroelectric plant operation.

	PGE also commits the individual units of its thermal generating plants based on unit
	availability and energy market conditions.  These plants do not receive an automatic 
	generation control (AGC) signal.  The determination of the fixed hourly outputs of these
	thermal generating plants takes into account a number of factors including:  the cost and
	availability of fuel, the availability of PGE's and regional hydroelectric generating plants,
	the energy market and the terms of the joint operating agreements.

	System Lambda
	
	PGE does not calculate a system lambda because demand following is not performed by

Since all base load generation is at or below $21/MWh, all units are generally loaded in at maximum LES shares for all hours.  Any surplus generation is sold in the interconnection if conditions permit.  If not, the highest cost base load resource is backed down until scheduled resources = scheduled load.  Any additional resource requirements are supplied (in order) from the combined cycle aero units, simple cycle aero, simple cycle combustion turbines based on the price of natural gas, OR, pool purchases if the market price is below the LES cost of internal generation.  LES gas contracts are such that we can make these decisions on a real-time hour by hour basis as well as day in advance, and adjust internal generation so the LES can take advantage of market conditions.

Since there are no agreements for PNM economic dispatch of non-PNM generation resources within the PNM Balancing Authority, each utility within the PNM Balancing Authority independently performs economic dispatch of their own generation resources.  The majority of PNM Balancing Authority generation resources belong to PNM.  PNM generation resources are economically dispatched as follows:

PNM purchases under long term PPA (Prior Purchase Adjustment), the entire output of the Taiban Mesa Wind Farm (204 MWs).  This resource is dispatched as must take.

PNM Palo Verde nuclear generation is the lowest cost PNM generation resource.  It is also very undesirable to curtail Palo Verde nuclear generation from a plant operations perspective.  Therefore, PNM Palo Verde generation is always run at its full capability. 

PNM San Juan generation is typically the next lowest cost PNM generation resource.  That generation is on Automatic Generation Control to follow swings in PNM area control error (ACE).   PNM ownership of San Juan units is spread over four units.  PNM's Energy Management System (EMS) is equipped with an economic dispatch function.  

PNM Four Corners generation is usually PNM's next resource in the dispatch stack.  It does not provide AGC, it is typically fully loaded, except when the spot market is lower than the Four Corners incremental cost.    

PNM owns one third of the Luna Energy Facility.  This is a two on one combined cycle gas unit with an optimum heat rate of 7200.  This Luna unit is on Automatic Generation Control (AGC) and is dispatched in economic basis.

PNM owns 100% of the Afton Power Plant.  This plant is a one on one combined cycle gas plant with an optimum heat rate of 7200.

Lordsburg Generating Station is two gas only turbines located in southern New Mexico, owned and operated by PNM.  It is started for load, regulation or for spinning reserves resources, provided transmission is purchased to the delivery point, and for energy sales, if its operating costs are within the range of spot market costs.

PNM Reeves is a gas plant located in Albuquerque.  It is started for load, for spinning reserves resources, for loadside used for transmission support, for conditional firm transmission sales, and for energy sales, if its operating costs are within the range of spot market costs.

Valencia is a gas plant located south of Albuquerque.  Its total output is purchased by PNM.  It is started for load, for reserves, for load side used for transmission support, to support conditional firm transmission sales, and for energy sales.  It is typically dispatched after Reeves and before Delta.  However, Valencia can come online much more quickly than Reeves, so in the event of a unit trip, Valencia may be brought online instead of Reeves.  

Delta-Person is a gas/oil plant located in Albuquerque.  Its total output is purchased by PNM and is dispatched economically, usually after Valencia generation. When on line, Delta-Person is on Automatic Generation Control to follow swings in PNM area control error (ACE).  It is started for load, to support conditional firm transmission sales, or for loadside used for transmission support.  It can also be brought online to recover from a unit trip; in such cases it may be brought online before Reeves or Valencia. 

In 2011, 22 MWs of Solar generation were added to PNM’s renewable generation portfolio.  The Facilities are geographically dispersed throughout PNM’s Balancing Authority area.  While these resources are not economically dispatched, they are included in daily unit commitments.

PNM System Lambda Calculation

Since PNM is not able to economically dispatch non-PNM Balancing Authority generation resources, the System Lambda calculation only includes PNM generation resources.  If generation resources having an incremental fuel cost less than the calculated San Juan lambda are being curtailed, the PNM Real Time Power Trader manually schedules the lower cost resource to replace the higher lambda San Juan resource.  The calculated San Juan lambda value is manually replaced with the lower value.  If the PNM San Juan generation resource is fully scheduled, except for unloaded capacity needed for regulation and spinning reserves, and PNM is using generation resources having a higher incremental fuel cost (such as purchased energy with a higher cost than the San Juan lambda), the PNM Real Time Power Trader replaces the previously calculated lambda value with the cost of the next incremental generation resource available to PNM.

The Economic Dispatch (ED) function establishes the optimum basepoints for the in-service economically dispatchable thermal generating units in a manner than minimizes the total system production cost, considering the effects of transmission losses, while respecting unit economic and response rate limits.

Significant Features and Benefits

Event triggered ED executions, following relevant changes in power system or generating unit conditions, ensure the timely calculation of optimum basepoints.  Economic participation factors, representing a linear approximation of the ED function, allow adjustment of optimum basepoints to compensate for minor system load changes occurring between ED executions.

The emission constraints of the 1990 Clean Air act can be included in the Economic Dispatch function as an option.

A dual dispatch approach advises the operator of optimum basepoints for selected manually controlled units as well as for automatically controlled units.

Actual and ideal production cost differences reveal system regulation costs and the cost of manually controlled unit operation at nonoptimum basepoints.

Use of real-time penalty factors, derived by security analysis functions (if provided), to account for transmission losses provides the most accurate analysis, ensuring the maximum possible fuel savings.

B-matrix and constant coefficient penalty factor calculation methods account for transmission losses when real-time penalty factors are not available.

Multiple fuel cost and heat rate curve data sets allow modeling of different fuel types and operating conditions for each generating unit.

Technical Overview

Activation Mechanism

The real-time ED function calculates optimum basepoints for the dispatchable thermal generating units on a periodic, operator demand, or event triggered basis.  ED executes periodically when a tunable maximum time period between basepoint calculations, typically five-minutes, has elapsed.  The operator may request execution of the ED function via the CRT displays.  To ensure the most economical system operation, ED also executes as a result of the following events.

The control area load changes significantly since the last basepoint calculation

The control area net interchange changes significantly since the last basepoint calculation

The dispatch status of a generating unit changes

The Automatic Generation Control function, using economic participation factors, adjusts the economic basepoint of a dispatchable generating unit to an economic limit

The operator modifies generating unit fuel cost or heat rate curve data

A tunable minimum time period between basepoint calculations prevents excessive event triggered ED executions.

Economic Basepoint Calculations

ED obtains the most economic system operation when the incremental cost of power delivered to the load is the same for all dispatchable generating units.  Calculation of the unit economic basepoints involves the solution of a set of coordination equations of the following form via a Lagrangian method:

	FCOSTi * dli/dPi;=LAMBDA/PFi

Subject to the constraint equation:

	   n
	?P?= DISPGEN
	   1

where:

	LAMBDA	=  	system incremental cost ($/MW.h)
	FCOSTi	=  	fuel cost for unit ?($/MMBTU)
	dl?/dP?	=  	incremental heat rate for unit i (MMBTU/MW.h)
	PF?        	=  	penalty factor for unit ?
	P?  	=  	economic basepoint for unit ?(MW)
	n  	=  	number of generating units dispatched
	DISPGEN 	= 		total dispatched generation (MW)

A variable number of straight line segments, defined by monotonically increasing ordinates and abscissas, approximate the generating unit incremental heat rate curves.  Multiple fuel cost and incremental heat rate curve data sets, typically six for each generating unit, permit modeling of different fuel types and/or unit operating conditions.  CRT displays allow operator selection of the fuel cost and incremental heat rate curve data set most applicable to the current conditions.  On-line modification for fuel cost and heat rate data allow modeling of current unit conditions.

A study mode dispatch calculates economic basepoints for selected manually controlled units as well as for automatically controlled units.  For the most economic system operation, generating units should operate at basepoints determined from dispatch considering units operating in the AUTOMATIC, ECONOMIC, and MANUAL-DISPATCH control modes.  The results of this dispatch consist of economic basepoints, presented on CRT displays that serve only as operator recommendations.  In this dispatch, unit high and low economic limits constrain the basepoint calculation.

Economic Participation Factors

To accurately reflect actual system economics, the AGC function requires basepoints from a real-time dispatch considering only units operating in the AUTOMATIC and ECONOMIC control mode.  The results of this dispatch consist of economic basepoints and economic participation factors that are input to the AGC desired generation calculation.  The economic participation factors, a linear representation of the incremental cost function for each generating unit operating in the AUTOMATIC control mode, allow adjustment of the economic basepoints to compensate for the minor system load changes that occur between ED executions.

Their use reduces the ED function execution frequency without sacrificing economic operation.  In this dispatch, unit response rate limits as well as high and low economic limits constrain the basepoint calculation.

Penalty Factors

Penalty factors adjust the incremental cost for each generating unit to account for transmission losses incurred due to an incremental change in generation.  The ED function supports three penalty factor calculation methods, real-time, B-Matrix and constant coefficient.  The operator may select, via CRT display, the penalty factor calculation method to be used.

The Penalty Factor Calculation function derives real-time penalty factors using the Jacobian algorithm based on the current power system configuration and condition, as determined by the State Estimation function.  A CRT display presents the real-time penalty factors for each generating unit.

Penalty factors derived from B-matrix and constant coefficient methods account for transmission losses incurred in a specific power system configuration and condition.  The B-matrix penalty factor for a given generating unit is dependent on injections at prespecified power system busses, generally, where generating units, tie-lines and nonconforming loads are connected.  The constant coefficient penalty factor for a given generating unit is linearly proportional to the total system generation.  To provide more accurate assessments using these techniques, ED automatically selects from several sets of B-matrix and constant coefficient data, representing different power system configurations and conditions, based on the system load level.




Emission Dispatch (Option)

The Clean Air Act of 1990 defines a two phased reduction in the emissions of electric generation plants.  From 1995 to 2000, Phase I limits the SO2 emissions of pre-selected generating units.  Phase II becomes effective after the year 2000 and restricts SO2 and NOx emissions for all units over 25 MW.

The emission dispatch calculates generating unit basepoints that minimize the company production cost as well as constraint emissions to hourly emission limits determined by long range planning studies.

Initially, ED performs a dispatch based on generating unit fuel costs and heat rate characteristics.  The pertinent results of this minimum cost dispatch include unit basepoints, system production cost rate and system NOx and SO2 emission rate.  System production cost and emission rates are a summation of individual unit production cost and emission rates, calculated by integration of the incremental heat and emission rate curves to the unit basepoint.

ED performs a second dispatch based on generating unit fuel costs and composite heat and emission rate characteristics.  The composite heat and emission rate characteristics result from a summation of incremental cost curve breakpoints and cost-weighted incremental emission curve breakpoints.  The pertinent results of this dispatch include unit basepoints and system production cost rate and emission rates.

From the results of the two dispatches, ED calculates and emission improvement cost, i.e., the ratio of the increase in production cost to the decrease in emission.  If the emission improvement cost exceeds an operator specified maximum limit, indicating that a reduction in emission is not cost effective, the dispatch solution is complete even if the system emission rates exceed the emission rate limits.  This situation constitutes a recommendation to purchase emission improvement cost is less than an operator specified minimum limit, indicating that a small increase in fuel costs results in significant emission resolutions, ED increases the emission cost weighing factor and the solution continues.

ED compares the system emission rates with NO and SO2 emission rate limits derived from the hourly emission allowances calculated by long term planning functions.  The derived NOx and SO2 emission rate limits consider actual accumulated emissions and expected generation requirement changes.  If the system emission rate exceeds an emission rate limit, ED increases the corresponding emission cost weighing factor and performs another dispatch.  ED repeats the solution process until the system NOx and SO2 emission rates meet the emission rate limits or the emission improvement cost exceeds its limit.

The results of the emission dispatch include the following quantities:

Cost of compliance with emission limits
Optimum generating unit basepoints and participation factors
Expected hourly and instantaneous generating unit and total company emissions (SO2, NOx)
Hourly and instantaneous generating unit and total company fuel usage

If an inexpensive coal unit is on AGC at the same time a combustion turbine is on, but not on AGC, then the system lambda might be $20/MWh when the combustion turbine is costing $50/MWh or more.

Also, OPPD's reported system lambda does not consider the cost of purchases or sales.  When OPPD has loaded its inexpensive coal generation, OPPD may choose to purchase energy, which is more expensive than coal but less expensive than operating a combustion turbine.

Idaho Power’s thermal resources include shares of 7 coal-fired thermal units at 3 plants,  4 natural gas-fired simple cycle combustion units at 2 plants and a natural gas-fired combined cycle plant.
Our thermal resources and the single natural gas-fired combined cycle plant are dispatched on a monthly or weekly basis, depending upon the season.

Typically more than 90% of energy transactions processed by NYISO occur in the DAM.  A software program called Security Constrained Unit Commitment (""SCUC"") determines the amount of energy expected to be needed within the state for each day.  NYISO will schedule the generating units that can most economically satisfy the energy needed to supply customers' demand and allow a sufficient reserve for contingencies.  The New York Marginal Cost of Energy is the base price that NYISO must pay to obtain the needed energy.  This base price is determined at the NYISO reference bus, so named because it is the reference against which losses, congestion, shift factors, penalty factors and other system mathematical quantities are calculated.  It is physically located at the Marcy 345 kV substation in Marcy, New York.  In transmitting energy across the state, there are additional costs for the electrical losses and sometimes for congestion when transmission lines become overloaded.  The DAM zonal Local Based Marginal Prices are determined by adding the marginal cost of energy, the marginal cost of losses and the marginal cost of congestion.

Description of Economic Dispatch

Calculation of System lambda

The goal of economic dispatch is to match electric power resources with electricity demand in near real-time on a least incremental cost basis.  For a given system generation requirement, the cheapest operating point occurs where the incremental power cost (lambda) for each controllable unit is equal.  The mathematical derivation proving the merits of equal lambda dispatch may be found in most power system analysis text books.  The controller must therefore be able to find the right system lambda and the desired generation of each unit at that lambda.

Economic (equal lambda) dispatch at Progress Energy Carolinas is achieved with the use of unit incremental heat rate curves, fuel costs, emissions costs, variable O&M and penalty factors for transmission losses.  The incremental cost curve for each generating unit is the product of the incremental heat rate curve (that considers emissions per MBTU of heat input) multiplied by the unit fuel cost and adjusted by the penalty factor to account for transmission losses and an associated unit variable O&M.  While attempting to maintain an ACE in compliance with applicable NERC Reliability Standards and such as not to be a burden to the Interconnection, thus fulfilling the Balancing Authority function, each unit’s incremental cost curve is set equal to the system incremental cost (lambda) to determine the desired unit output (MW).  As load increases and generation increases to achieve the desired ACE, a new system lambda is selected in order to match generation with load.  An iterative process of selecting lambda and determining unit output until ACE is achieved within the desired acceptable range is employed constantly on the Energy Management System.  As load diminishes, generation is reduced to balance resources with demand to achieve an ACE in the desired acceptable range.  Here again, a new system lambda is selected and unit incremental cost curves evaluated to match generation with load.

The coordination equations to be solved by EDC are:

(CJ* df/dpj + Imj) * PFj = LAMBDA

Where: 	Cj 		=Fuel cost for th jth unit.
	dfj/dpj		=Incremental heat rate for the jth unit.
	IMj		=Incremental maintenance cost for the jth unit.
	PFj		=Penalty Factor for the jth unit.
			  Used to bias entire unit cost.
	LAMBDA		=Incremental cost of supplying power to a hypothetical load center of the area.

In addition to the coordination equations, the following power balance equation must be satisfied:

SUM OF Basepoints of 
               dispatched		=SUM OF		Actual generation of dispatched units (at beginning of dispatch)
              
               generation		+ SUM OF		rate-limited difference between base points and current generation of units on ramp, base load, or base load and regulating

			+DC
Where: DG is normally FACE, but is limited to the maximum MW all units on control may move during the interval between EDC executions.  DC always has the same sign as FACE

The EDC routine consists of an inner and outer loop.  The inner loop is a binary serach routine for solving the coordination equations in order to obtain base points for a fixed value of LAMBDA.

During this solution it is necessary, of course, to recognize the high and low ecomonic limits and the calculated high and low rate limits.  Once the base points have been determined an outer loop calculation is made to see if the power balance equation is satisfied.  If not, LAMBDA is adjusted, the inner loop is then reentered and a new set of base points calculated. 

This proceedure will continue until one of these conditions is met:

1.  Both the coordination equations and the power balance equation are satisfied to within specified tolerances.

2.  Either the coordination equations or the power balance equation does not converse because of numerical or physical problems.  In this case a message is sent to the system console.

Assuming that a valid solution is obtained, the ecomonic participation factors are computed for those units  which are to follow load.  The base points and exonimic participation factors (for the load following units) are then updated for use by the AGC routines.  The ecomonic participation factors for the units which are not load following are set to zero.

Economic participation factors are calculated by assuming that the slope of the LAMBDA versus genration curve is constant over a short range.  The load is increased by a percentage.  DELEDC, and a new dispatch is made.  Ecomonic participation factors for load above thesum of base points are then calculated:

UEPFUPj = (change in unit j generation)/(change in system load)

The load is then decreased to the same percentage below its original value, and a new dispatch is made.  Ecomonic participation factors for the load below the sum of base points are calculated in the same way as the increasing ones.

EDC utilizes the Auto-Ranging Binary Search method.  It operates by dividing the search region into two, deciding which half the desired result is in, dividing that half into two, and so on until a solution is obtained.  Starting with the desired generation DESGEN (=sum of all generatin from telemetry + FACE) and an initial value of LAMBDA (usually the value from the last EDC),the calculation proceeds until the error (MWn-DESGEN) is less than a set fraction of DESGEN.  This fraction, ERRTWP< resides in the database.

The binary search algorithm will always work for the Economic Dispatch Calculation when given a realistic set of conditions.  Discontinuous heat rate curve is also supported.  Discontinuous curves have slopes that are infinite at certain points.

Part II - Schedule 6.  Control Area System Lambda Data
Description of Economic Dispatch - System Lambda


Duke’s approach to economic dispatch involves the iterative process of evaluating system incremental costs, unit generation levels, and system load requirements.  The theory behind economic dispatch is to operate the generation units at an equal incremental cost (adjusted for transmission losses) to minimize system costs.  The process is conceptually described as follows:
Select a system incremental cost to evaluate based on system load requirements.
Use the selected system incremental cost to calculate unit incremental costs using unit penalty factors.  Unit penalty factors relate unit generation levels to system transmission losses.
Calculate unit generation levels using the unit incremental cost and unit incremental cost curves.
Sum up unit generation levels to get system generation.
Compare system generation to system load requirements.
If system generation is less than system load requirements, select a new system incremental cost that is greater than the previous system incremental cost.  If system generation is greater than system load requirement, select a new system incremental cost that is less than the previous system incremental cost.
Return to step 2 and continue the process.

Once system generation equals the system load requirements (within a small deadband), the economic dispatch process is complete.  The last system incremental cost is system lambda, and the last unit generation levels are the optimal generation levels.

116,2012,12,0,100,,"5.5  Economic Allocation - Lambda Dispatch

The Lambda algorithm function determines generator base points and allocates additional reserve to determine new dispatch limits prior to the final base point calculation.

The classical Lambda algorithm solution technique is employed along with additional features that are described below.  The algorithm solution provides a set of generation levels and inverse slopes of the incremental cost curve.  The slope values are later applied for the determination of economic participation factors.

The following notation is used:

P			-	generation MW for a unit being dispatched
Sum p	-	Sum of individual p values being dispatched
DMW	-	total dispatch MW
c			-	generator unit cost curve; c(p) = cost at p output
L			-	Lagrange multiplier whose solution value will be the solution Lambda 

5.5.1  Classical Iterative Approach

The objective of the Lambda algorithm is to find a set of generation p values at minimum total cost for a given desired MW value, DMW:

DMW = SUM p

Since the total cost function is the sum of individual (non-linear) cost functions, the classical Lagrange multiplier method minimizes the augmented cost function F:

F = Sum c(p) + L * (Sum p - PD - TL)

subject to:

MNDP £ p £MXDP

where:	c						-	cost function of generation p
L						-	Lambda (Lagrange multiplier)
PD					-	total system load or demand; constant
TL					-	total transmission losses which is a function of p
MXDP,MNDP	-	given dispatch limits

For the solution set of p values, the term (Sum p - PD - TL) is zero and F will be the minimum total cost.

The minimum of F is determined when each first derivative of F with respect to generator i, df/dp(i), is zero.  The solution criterion is met by the simultaneous solution of the following coordination equations:

(dC(1)/dP(1)) * PF(1) = L
(dC(2)/dP(2)) * PF(2) = L
 .
 .
 .
(dC(n)/dP(n)) * PF(n) = L

where:	dC(i)/dP(i)	-	dc/dp, incremental cost c of unit i at generation level P
PF(i)			-	1/(1 - dTL/dP(i))
-	penalty factor as function of the incremental transmission loss for generator i, dTL/dP(i)
L					-	incremental cost at delivered power, Lambda

These equations state that the incremental cost of delivered power is equal for all dispatched resources.  The penalty factor takes into account the cost of transferring the generated power to the load center.  The penalty factors are assembled by the ED data processing function from one of four sets of penalty factors and entered dispatch (multiplier) factors found in the database.

The MW output of each generator is obtained from its incremental cost curve for the iteration lambda.  If the MW value is outside of the unit dispatch limits, the output is held at the appropriate limit.

5.5.2  Additional Features

Additional features enhance the classical Lambda dispatch algorithm.  These features are:

·	fixing and removing resources from iterations

·	Lambda postulate algorithm

The fixing and removing of units from further iterations is performed when the previous iteration does not converge to the solution.  This process consists of recognizing the over- or under-generating state of the previous iteration pass.  At this point, the units are fixed at their high limits in the under-generating state and removed from the iterative loop, since their dispatch levels would not change in further iterations.  Units are fixed at their low limits in the over-generating state in a similar fashion.

In the Lambda algorithm, the composite slope at the previous lambda from units remaining in the iteration loop is applied as part of the first-order Taylor's approximation of lambda:

L(new) = L(prev) + m' * MWERROR

subject to dynamic high and low lambda limits LMAX and LMIN:

LMIN £ L(new) £ LMAX

where:	m'				-	slope of the composite incremental cost curve
L( )				-	lambda postulate
MWERROR	-	the excess of (over-generation) or lack of (under-generation) dispatch MW's
LMAX		-	L(prev) when L(new) will be smaller
LMIN			-	L(prev) when L(new) will be larger
By constraining L within LMAX and LMIN, a diverging solution is prevented.  If the new L fails the limit test, it is not set to the limit but rather is recomputed by bisection:

L(new) = (LMAX + LMIN)/2

5.5.3  Coordination Equations Solution

The solution of the coordination equations proceeds in an iterative fashion.  The major steps in the solution include:

·	postulation of solution lambda L

·	derivation of unit dispatch MW from the ICC for all units

·	decision as to the necessity for another iteration (by comparing total dispatched MW to total desired MW)

·	fixing and removing resources prior to next iteration

Solution lambda L is initialized by observing resource limits.  The incremental cost LMIN associated with the cheapest resource at its minimum limit and the incremental cost LMAX associated with the most expensive resource at its maximum limit are used in the initial guess of L.  When the previous solution is within these limits, its value is used as L(0); otherwise L(0) is computed by bisection as follows:

L(0) = (LMAX + LMIN)/2

Postulation of lambda between iterations utilizes the slope of the composite incremental cost curve at the current guess of lambda:

L(new) = L(prev) + (DMW-Sum p)/INVSLP

where:	L(new)	-	new guess of lambda
L(prev)	-	previous iteration guess of lambda
INVSLP	-	inverse slope of the composite cost curve at L(prev)
= sum (inverse(unit ICC slopes))
DMW		-	total desired dispatch MW
Sum p		-	sum of base points at previous iteration

Resources are dispatched at the current guess for solution lambda.  Each dispatched MW level is constrained by the unit dispatch limits; when the dispatch level is beyond a limit, it is set to that limit.

Upon comparison of DMW and the sum of base points, it can be determined if the current guess of lambda results in too much generation or too little generation.  In certain situations, units can be removed from further calculations.  This technique improves the performance of the solution.  The positive slope characteristic of the unit ICC's allows this assumption.

The following outline illustrates the solution procedure:

1.0	Initialization
1.1	Make initial guess for solution lambda; determine LMAX and LMIN
1.1.1	If old solution outside (LMIN<LMAX), then set L(0) = (LMAX + LMIN)/2

Economic Dispatch Solution Module (EDSOL)
Given a system total generation requirement, EDSOL determines the most economical generation level for all generators under economic dispatch control, taking into account the generators input-output characteristics, the generators fuel costs and the power losses over the transmission network.
A generating unit's input-output characteristics relate the fuel rate input, MBTU/HR, to the generator's power output (MW). This is usually known as the heat rate curve. The incremental heat rate curve, as the name implies, relates the incremental fuel rate input, MBTU/MWHR, to the generator's power output. Multiplying by the generator's selected fuel's cost, $/MBTU, the generator's incremental cost curve is obtained ($/MWHR vs. MW). The generator's efficiency value (in percent) is also incorporated (by normalization and division) into the determination of the generator's incremental cost curve coefficients. The incremental heat rate curve is linearized and defined by up to eighteen straight- line segments. Each segment is defined by its two end points.
Mathematically, the economic dispatch problem can be expressed as the minimization of the generation cost, which is defined as:
	C = S ci (Pi)						(1)
Where
	C	=	generation cost
	Pi	=	output power of generator i
	ci (Pi)	=	fuel cost for Pi
Subject to the following constraints:
	Pmini £ Pi £ Pmaxi					(2)
	S Pi = Load + Loss (P1. Pi, ...)			(3)
Where
	Pmini	=	minimum power of generator i
	Pmaxi	=	maximum power of generator i
	Load	=	system load
	Loss	=	line losses
Now, consider the augmented Lagrange cost function:
	£ = C - l (S Pi - Load - Loss)				(4)
The optimal solution is given by:
	¶£ = 0
	¶Pi							(5)

i.e.,	¶Ci (Pi)      -      l (1 - ¶ Loss)   = 0
	  ¶ Pi                             ¶ Pi
Which gives the optimal coordination equations:
	l = Pfi    ¶Ci (Pi)						(6)
                                       ¶Pi
Where
	Pfi   =       1      		is the penalty factor of generator i.
                  1 - ¶ Loss
                        ¶ Pi
Equation (6) shows that the optimal dispatch is achieved when all generators operate at equal incremental cost l.
Calculating the penalty factors Pfi, which are a measure of transmission losses, requires the solution of load flow equations.
The Economic Dispatch Solution routine's (EDSOL's) caller normally obtains the penalty factors from the database as calculated by Network Analysis. They can alternately be set by the user or set to unity (1.0).
Any Power Application that provides the appropriate set of input data can utilize EDSOL routine. The caller can optionally direct EDSOL to obtain certain input data, such as generators incremental heat rate curves coefficients and generators fuel selections and costs, directly from the appropriate database tables.
EDSOL begins its processing by adjusting the caller's total required generation to reflect the outputs available from off-control or from base loaded generators. The adjusted value is EDSOL's total required generation from among the economically dispatched generators. In the case of the Economic Dispatch Control (EDC) calling EDSOL, EDSOL develops its total required generation by summing the current actual MW outputs of the economically dispatched generators.
If EDSOL finds that its total required generation can not be satisfied due to being out of range of the EDC High or EDC Low limits sum, then each dispatched generator's desired generation value is set equal to the appropriate EDC limit before returning to the caller. EDSOL also returns the appropriate solution status indication, which the caller can check to detect and possibly act upon (such as by alerting the dispatcher or user) the situation.
EDSOL develops each dispatched generator's incremental cost curve coefficients, as described above, and determines the system's maximum and minimum possible values of Lambda as the initial bounds of the iterative Lambda search.
The set of simultaneous equations described above is solved iteratively by establishing a trial value of Lambda to calculate each dispatched generator's desired power output and the system sum of the desired power outputs. If the system sum of the desired power outputs matches (within a designated tolerance) EDSOL's total required generation, then the iterative Lambda search terminates. Otherwise, the trial value of Lambda is adjusted (using a binary search protected Newton's method adjustment) and another iteration's calculations are performed. The output of the terminated Lambda search is a tentative set of desired output values that are within the generators EDC High and EDC Low limits and will satisfy EDSOL's total required generation.
Each generator's tentative desired output is checked against the generator's designated and calculated disallowed regions. If one or more generator's tentative desired output is found to be within a disallowed region, then one such generator is selected to have its desired output subsequently clamped to the appropriate edge of the disallowed region. With that generator effectively removed from the solution calculations, EDSOL returns to again perform the iterative Lambda search among the reduced set of economically dispatched generators, and then again check for the need to move a generator's desired output value out of a disallowed region.
The disallowed regions check loop is terminated once EDSOL finds that no generator's desired output lies within a disallowed region.
If it is not possible to find a closely matching economic dispatch solution (the designated or calculated disallowed regions cause the economic dispatch solution problem to be excessively constrained), then EDSOL returns the appropriate solution status indication to the caller.
EDSOL returns to the caller the calculated value of Lambda and the set of desired outputs for the economically dispatched generators. Other data is also made available for the caller, such as the solution's status indication (Normal In Range Solution, Constrained By EDC High Limits Sum, etc.), a list of the indices of the economically dispatched generators and the set of calculated (pseudo) disallowed regions to be avoided to limit the starting or stopping of mills.

The Economic Dispatch (ED) function establishes the optimum basepoints for the in-service economically dispatchable thermal generating units in a manner than minimizes the total system production cost, considering the effects of transmission losses, while respecting unit economic and response rate limits.

Significant Features and Benefits

Event triggered ED executions, following relevant changes in power system or generating unit conditions, ensure the timely calculation of optimum basepoints.  Economic participation factors, representing a linear approximation of the ED function, allow adjustment of optimum basepoints to compensate for minor system load changes occurring between ED executions.

The emission constraints of the 1990 Clean Air act can be included in the Economic Dispatch function as an option.

A dual dispatch approach advises the operator of optimum basepoints for selected manually controlled units as well as for automatically controlled units.

Actual and ideal production cost differences reveal system regulation costs and the cost of manually controlled unit operation at nonoptimum basepoints.

Use of real-time penalty factors, derived by security analysis functions (if provided), to account for transmission losses provides the most accurate analysis, ensuring the maximum possible fuel savings.

B-matrix and constant coefficient penalty factor calculation methods account for transmission losses when real-time penalty factors are not available.

Multiple fuel cost and heat rate curve data sets allow modeling of different fuel types and operating conditions for each generating unit.

Technical Overview

Activation Mechanism

The real-time ED function calculates optimum basepoints for the dispatchable thermal generating units on a periodic, operator demand, or event triggered basis.  ED executes periodically when a tunable maximum time period between basepoint calculations, typically five-minutes, has elapsed.  The operator may request execution of the ED function via the CRT displays.  To ensure the most economical system operation, ED also executes as a result of the following events.

The control area load changes significantly since the last basepoint calculation

The control area net interchange changes significantly since the last basepoint calculation

The dispatch status of a generating unit changes

The Automatic Generation Control function, using economic participation factors, adjusts the economic basepoint of a dispatchable generating unit to an economic limit

The operator modifies generating unit fuel cost or heat rate curve data

A tunable minimum time period between basepoint calculations prevents excessive event triggered ED executions.

Economic Basepoint Calculations

ED obtains the most economic system operation when the incremental cost of power delivered to the load is the same for all dispatchable generating units.  Calculation of the unit economic basepoints involves the solution of a set of coordination equations of the following form via a Lagrangian method:

	FCOSTi * dli/dPi;=LAMBDA/PFi

Subject to the constraint equation:

	   n
	?P?= DISPGEN
	   1

where:

	LAMBDA	=  	system incremental cost ($/MW.h)
	FCOSTi	=  	fuel cost for unit ?($/MMBTU)
	dl?/dP?	=  	incremental heat rate for unit i (MMBTU/MW.h)
	PF?        	=  	penalty factor for unit ?
	P?  	=  	economic basepoint for unit ?(MW)
	n  	=  	number of generating units dispatched
	DISPGEN 	= 		total dispatched generation (MW)

A variable number of straight line segments, defined by monotonically increasing ordinates and abscissas, approximate the generating unit incremental heat rate curves.  Multiple fuel cost and incremental heat rate curve data sets, typically six for each generating unit, permit modeling of different fuel types and/or unit operating conditions.  CRT displays allow operator selection of the fuel cost and incremental heat rate curve data set most applicable to the current conditions.  On-line modification for fuel cost and heat rate data allow modeling of current unit conditions.

A study mode dispatch calculates economic basepoints for selected manually controlled units as well as for automatically controlled units.  For the most economic system operation, generating units should operate at basepoints determined from dispatch considering units operating in the AUTOMATIC, ECONOMIC, and MANUAL-DISPATCH control modes.  The results of this dispatch consist of economic basepoints, presented on CRT displays that serve only as operator recommendations.  In this dispatch, unit high and low economic limits constrain the basepoint calculation.

Economic Participation Factors

To accurately reflect actual system economics, the AGC function requires basepoints from a real-time dispatch considering only units operating in the AUTOMATIC and ECONOMIC control mode.  The results of this dispatch consist of economic basepoints and economic participation factors that are input to the AGC desired generation calculation.  The economic participation factors, a linear representation of the incremental cost function for each generating unit operating in the AUTOMATIC control mode, allow adjustment of the economic basepoints to compensate for the minor system load changes that occur between ED executions.

Their use reduces the ED function execution frequency without sacrificing economic operation.  In this dispatch, unit response rate limits as well as high and low economic limits constrain the basepoint calculation.

Penalty Factors

Penalty factors adjust the incremental cost for each generating unit to account for transmission losses incurred due to an incremental change in generation.  The ED function supports three penalty factor calculation methods, real-time, B-Matrix and constant coefficient.  The operator may select, via CRT display, the penalty factor calculation method to be used.

The Penalty Factor Calculation function derives real-time penalty factors using the Jacobian algorithm based on the current power system configuration and condition, as determined by the State Estimation function.  A CRT display presents the real-time penalty factors for each generating unit.

Penalty factors derived from B-matrix and constant coefficient methods account for transmission losses incurred in a specific power system configuration and condition.  The B-matrix penalty factor for a given generating unit is dependent on injections at prespecified power system busses, generally, where generating units, tie-lines and nonconforming loads are connected.  The constant coefficient penalty factor for a given generating unit is linearly proportional to the total system generation.  To provide more accurate assessments using these techniques, ED automatically selects from several sets of B-matrix and constant coefficient data, representing different power system configurations and conditions, based on the system load level.




Emission Dispatch (Option)

The Clean Air Act of 1990 defines a two phased reduction in the emissions of electric generation plants.  From 1995 to 2000, Phase I limits the SO2 emissions of pre-selected generating units.  Phase II becomes effective after the year 2000 and restricts SO2 and NOx emissions for all units over 25 MW.

The emission dispatch calculates generating unit basepoints that minimize the company production cost as well as constraint emissions to hourly emission limits determined by long range planning studies.

Initially, ED performs a dispatch based on generating unit fuel costs and heat rate characteristics.  The pertinent results of this minimum cost dispatch include unit basepoints, system production cost rate and system NOx and SO2 emission rate.  System production cost and emission rates are a summation of individual unit production cost and emission rates, calculated by integration of the incremental heat and emission rate curves to the unit basepoint.

ED performs a second dispatch based on generating unit fuel costs and composite heat and emission rate characteristics.  The composite heat and emission rate characteristics result from a summation of incremental cost curve breakpoints and cost-weighted incremental emission curve breakpoints.  The pertinent results of this dispatch include unit basepoints and system production cost rate and emission rates.

From the results of the two dispatches, ED calculates and emission improvement cost, i.e., the ratio of the increase in production cost to the decrease in emission.  If the emission improvement cost exceeds an operator specified maximum limit, indicating that a reduction in emission is not cost effective, the dispatch solution is complete even if the system emission rates exceed the emission rate limits.  This situation constitutes a recommendation to purchase emission improvement cost is less than an operator specified minimum limit, indicating that a small increase in fuel costs results in significant emission resolutions, ED increases the emission cost weighing factor and the solution continues.

ED compares the system emission rates with NO and SO2 emission rate limits derived from the hourly emission allowances calculated by long term planning functions.  The derived NOx and SO2 emission rate limits consider actual accumulated emissions and expected generation requirement changes.  If the system emission rate exceeds an emission rate limit, ED increases the corresponding emission cost weighing factor and performs another dispatch.  ED repeats the solution process until the system NOx and SO2 emission rates meet the emission rate limits or the emission improvement cost exceeds its limit.

The results of the emission dispatch include the following quantities:

Cost of compliance with emission limits
Optimum generating unit basepoints and participation factors
Expected hourly and instantaneous generating unit and total company emissions (SO2, NOx)
Hourly and instantaneous generating unit and total company fuel usage

Part II - Schedule 6.  Balancing Authority Area Description of Economic Dispatch

Balancing Authority Hourly System Lambda

PGE does not use an economic dispatch algorithm for demand following.  PGE's
Balancing Authority uses hydroelectric generating units for demand following.  The
following discussion describes PGE's 2013 Balancing Authority resources and how it
dispatches them to meet its Balancing Authority demand.

PGE's Resources

PGE Balancing Authority resources include:  seven wholly owned hydroelectric
generating plants, the purchase of the output of five hydroelectric generating plants, two
jointly owned coal-fired generating plants, three wholly owned combined cycle 
combustion turbine plants, one PURPA contract hydroelectric generating plant,
three non-PURPA contract hydroelectric generating plants and one non-utility thermal
generating plant.

Dispatch of PGE's Resources

Demand following is accomplished by sending the AGC signal either directly to PGE's 
Round Butte hydroelectric generating plant or to the control center which coordinates the
operation of PGE's four purchased hydroelectric generating plants.  This control center
coordinates the operation of several hydroelectric generating plants for the plant owners
and purchasers.

The individual units of the remaining seven of PGE's wholly owned and three non-
PURPA hydroelectric generating plants are typically operated at a fixed hourly
generating output that is based on river flow, reservoir elevation, unity availability, license
constraints and the regional coordination of hydroelectric plant operation.

PGE also commits the individual units of its thermal generating plants based on unit
availability and energy market conditions.  These plants do not receive an automatic
generation control (AGC) signal.  The determination of the fixed hourly outputs of these
thermal generating plants takes into account a number of factors including:  the cost and
availability of fuel, the availability of PGE's and regional hydroelectric generating plants,
the energy market and the terms of the joint operating agreements.

System Lambda

thermal generating units.",0

The dispatch instructions are communicated approximately 10 minutes prior to the end of the deployment interval, which is 5 minutes prior to the time the MP is expected to begin moving the resource.  The dispatch instructions are communicated via the internet to a web service using XML (approximately 10 minutes prior to the end of the interval).",0

The incremental energy cost, in #/MWh, to raise that unit's loading by one MW above its actual loading is defined as the AEP System's firm-load lambda.  Such determination and calculation are carried out on an hourly basis.

Prior to determining that incremental generating unit and the associated incremental cost, the computer program is coded to take into consideration all appropriate realities and obligations encountered while the AEP System's generation resources are operating on real-time.  These are:  consideration of each operating generating unit's seasonal capability, including condition deratings and partial outages, if any; exclusion of capacity blocks actually allocated to unit-power sales commitments; exclusion of the Donald C.

Omaha Public Power District (OPPD) uses an Economic Dispatch algorithm to determine system lambda.  Only units, which are able to respond to load control (Automatic Generation Control, AGC), are included in the Economic Dispatch calculation.  Therefore, if a much more expensive unit is on-line, such as a combustion turbine, but is not available to respond to AGC, then the cost of that unit is not reflected in the system lambda value.  If an inexpensive coal unit is on AGC at the same time a combustion turbine is on, but not on AGC, then the system lambda might be $20/MWh when the combustion turbine is costing $50/MWh or more.

Also, OPPD's reported system lambda does not consider the cost of purchases or sales.  When OPPD has loaded its inexpensive coal generation, OPPD may choose to purchase energy, which is more expensive than coal but less expensive than operating a combustion turbine. OPPD might back down some of its coal resources in order to meet operating reserves and load following obligations, and purchase a block of more expensive energy.  Under this scenario, reported system lambda would reflect the price of the coal generation on AGC, rather than the more expensive purchase.

Part II - Schedule 6.  Control Area System Lambda Data
Description of Economic Dispatch - System Lambda

Duke's approach to economic dispatch involves the iterative process of evaluating system incremental costs, unit genreation levels, and system load requirements.  The theory behind economic dispatch is to operate the generation units at an equal incremental cost (adjusted for transmission losses) to minimize system costs.  The process is conceptually described as follows:


Select a system incremental cost to evaluate based on system load requirements.

Use the selected system incremental cost to calculate unit incremental costs using unit penalty factors.  Unit penalty factors relate unit generation levels to system transmission losses.

Calculate unit generation levels using the unit incremental cost and unit incremental cost curves.

Sum up unit generation levels to get system generation.

Compare system generation to system load requirements.

If system generation is less than system load requirements, select a new system incremental cost that is greater than the previous system incremental cost.  If system generation is greater than system load requirement, select a new system incremental cost that is less than the previous system incremental cost.

Return to step 2 and continue the process.


Once system generation equals the system load requirements (within a small deadband), the economic dispatch process is complete.  The last system incremental cost is system lambda, and the last unit generation levels are the optimal generation levels.",0

236,2013,12,0,100,,"PNM Balancing Authority Economic Dispatch

Since there are no agreements for PNM economic dispatch of non-PNM generation resources within the PNM Balancing Authority, each utility within the PNM Balancing Authority independently performs economic dispatch of their own generation resources.  The majority of PNM Balancing Authority generation resources belong to PNM.  PNM generation resources are economically dispatched as follows:

PNM purchases under long term PPA (Prior Purchase Adjustment), the entire output of the Taiban Mesa Wind Farm (204 MWs).  This resource is dispatched as must take.

PNM Palo Verde nuclear generation is the lowest cost PNM generation resource.  It is also very undesirable to curtail Palo Verde nuclear generation from a plant operations perspective.  Therefore, PNM Palo Verde generation is always run at its full capability. 

PNM San Juan generation is typically the next lowest cost PNM generation resource.  That generation is on Automatic Generation Control to follow swings in PNM area control error (ACE).   PNM ownership of San Juan units is spread over four units.  PNM's Energy Management System (EMS) is equipped with an economic dispatch function.  

PNM Four Corners generation is usually PNM's next resource in the dispatch stack.  It does not provide AGC, it is typically fully loaded, except when the spot market is lower than the Four Corners incremental cost.    

PNM owns one third of the Luna Energy Facility.  This is a two on one combined cycle gas unit with an optimum heat rate of 7200.  This Luna unit is on Automatic Generation Control (AGC) and is dispatched in economic basis.

PNM owns 100% of the Afton Power Plant.  This plant is a one on one combined cycle gas plant with an optimum heat rate of 7200.

Lordsburg Generating Station is two gas only turbines located in southern New Mexico, owned and operated by PNM.  It is started for load, regulation or for spinning reserves resources, provided transmission is purchased to the delivery point, and for energy sales, if its operating costs are within the range of spot market costs.

PNM Reeves is a gas plant located in Albuquerque.  It is started for load, for spinning reserves resources, for loadside used for transmission support, for conditional firm transmission sales, and for energy sales, if its operating costs are within the range of spot market costs.

Valencia is a gas plant located south of Albuquerque.  Its total output is purchased by PNM.  It is started for load, for reserves, for load side used for transmission support, to support conditional firm transmission sales, and for energy sales.  It is typically dispatched after Reeves and before Delta.  However, Valencia can come online much more quickly than Reeves, so in the event of a unit trip, Valencia may be brought online instead of Reeves.  

Delta-Person is a gas/oil plant located in Albuquerque.  Its total output is purchased by PNM and is dispatched economically, usually after Valencia generation. When on line, Delta-Person is on Automatic Generation Control to follow swings in PNM area control error (ACE).  It is started for load, to support conditional firm transmission sales, or for loadside used for transmission support.  It can also be brought online to recover from a unit trip; in such cases it may be brought online before Reeves or Valencia. 

In 2013, another 21.5 MW’s of solar generation were added to PNM’s renewable generation portfolio for a total of 44 MW’s.  The Facilities are geographically dispersed throughout PNM’s Balancing Authority area.  While these resources are not economically dispatched, they are included in daily unit commitments.  

Albuquerque Solar Energy Center, 2 MW’s
Los Morros Solar Energy Center, 7 MW’s
Deming Solar Energy Center, 9 MW’s
Alamogordo Solar Energy Center, 5 MW’s
Las Vegas Solar Energy Center, 5 MW’s

PNM System Lambda Calculation

Since PNM is not able to economically dispatch non-PNM Balancing Authority generation resources, the System Lambda calculation only includes PNM generation resources.  If generation resources having an incremental fuel cost less than the calculated San Juan lambda are being curtailed, the PNM Real Time Power Trader manually schedules the lower cost resource to replace the higher lambda San Juan resource.  The calculated San Juan lambda value is manually replaced with the lower value.  If the PNM San Juan generation resource is fully scheduled, except for unloaded capacity needed for regulation and spinning reserves, and PNM is using generation resources having a higher incremental fuel cost (such as purchased energy with a higher cost than the San Juan lambda), the PNM Real Time Power Trader replaces the previously calculated lambda value with the cost of the next incremental generation resource available to PNM.

116,2013,12,0,100,,"5.5  Economic Allocation - Lambda Dispatch

The Lambda algorithm function determines generator base points and allocates additional reserve to determine new dispatch limits prior to the final base point calculation.

The classical Lambda algorithm solution technique is employed along with additional features that are described below.  The algorithm solution provides a set of generation levels and inverse slopes of the incremental cost curve.  The slope values are later applied for the determination of economic participation factors.

The following notation is used:

P			-	generation MW for a unit being dispatched
Sum p	-	Sum of individual p values being dispatched
DMW	-	total dispatch MW
c			-	generator unit cost curve; c(p) = cost at p output
L			-	Lagrange multiplier whose solution value will be the solution Lambda 

5.5.1  Classical Iterative Approach

The objective of the Lambda algorithm is to find a set of generation p values at minimum total cost for a given desired MW value, DMW:

DMW = SUM p

Since the total cost function is the sum of individual (non-linear) cost functions, the classical Lagrange multiplier method minimizes the augmented cost function F:

F = Sum c(p) + L * (Sum p - PD - TL)

subject to:

MNDP £ p £MXDP

where:	c						-	cost function of generation p
L						-	Lambda (Lagrange multiplier)
PD					-	total system load or demand; constant
TL					-	total transmission losses which is a function of p
MXDP,MNDP	-	given dispatch limits

For the solution set of p values, the term (Sum p - PD - TL) is zero and F will be the minimum total cost.

The minimum of F is determined when each first derivative of F with respect to generator i, df/dp(i), is zero.  The solution criterion is met by the simultaneous solution of the following coordination equations:

(dC(1)/dP(1)) * PF(1) = L
(dC(2)/dP(2)) * PF(2) = L
 .
 .
 .
(dC(n)/dP(n)) * PF(n) = L

where:	dC(i)/dP(i)	-	dc/dp, incremental cost c of unit i at generation level P
PF(i)			-	1/(1 - dTL/dP(i))
-	penalty factor as function of the incremental transmission loss for generator i, dTL/dP(i)
L					-	incremental cost at delivered power, Lambda

These equations state that the incremental cost of delivered power is equal for all dispatched resources.  The penalty factor takes into account the cost of transferring the generated power to the load center.  The penalty factors are assembled by the ED data processing function from one of four sets of penalty factors and entered dispatch (multiplier) factors found in the database.

The MW output of each generator is obtained from its incremental cost curve for the iteration lambda.  If the MW value is outside of the unit dispatch limits, the output is held at the appropriate limit.

5.5.2  Additional Features

Additional features enhance the classical Lambda dispatch algorithm.  These features are:

·	fixing and removing resources from iterations

·	Lambda postulate algorithm

The fixing and removing of units from further iterations is performed when the previous iteration does not converge to the solution.  This process consists of recognizing the over- or under-generating state of the previous iteration pass.  At this point, the units are fixed at their high limits in the under-generating state and removed from the iterative loop, since their dispatch levels would not change in further iterations.  Units are fixed at their low limits in the over-generating state in a similar fashion.

In the Lambda algorithm, the composite slope at the previous lambda from units remaining in the iteration loop is applied as part of the first-order Taylor's approximation of lambda:

L(new) = L(prev) + m' * MWERROR

subject to dynamic high and low lambda limits LMAX and LMIN:

LMIN £ L(new) £ LMAX

where:	m'				-	slope of the composite incremental cost curve
L( )				-	lambda postulate
MWERROR	-	the excess of (over-generation) or lack of (under-generation) dispatch MW's
LMAX		-	L(prev) when L(new) will be smaller
LMIN			-	L(prev) when L(new) will be larger
By constraining L within LMAX and LMIN, a diverging solution is prevented.  If the new L fails the limit test, it is not set to the limit but rather is recomputed by bisection:

L(new) = (LMAX + LMIN)/2

5.5.3  Coordination Equations Solution

The solution of the coordination equations proceeds in an iterative fashion.  The major steps in the solution include:

·	postulation of solution lambda L

·	derivation of unit dispatch MW from the ICC for all units

·	decision as to the necessity for another iteration (by comparing total dispatched MW to total desired MW)

·	fixing and removing resources prior to next iteration

Solution lambda L is initialized by observing resource limits.  The incremental cost LMIN associated with the cheapest resource at its minimum limit and the incremental cost LMAX associated with the most expensive resource at its maximum limit are used in the initial guess of L.  When the previous solution is within these limits, its value is used as L(0); otherwise L(0) is computed by bisection as follows:

L(0) = (LMAX + LMIN)/2

Postulation of lambda between iterations utilizes the slope of the composite incremental cost curve at the current guess of lambda:

L(new) = L(prev) + (DMW-Sum p)/INVSLP

where:	L(new)	-	new guess of lambda
L(prev)	-	previous iteration guess of lambda
INVSLP	-	inverse slope of the composite cost curve at L(prev)
= sum (inverse(unit ICC slopes))
DMW		-	total desired dispatch MW
Sum p		-	sum of base points at previous iteration

Resources are dispatched at the current guess for solution lambda.  Each dispatched MW level is constrained by the unit dispatch limits; when the dispatch level is beyond a limit, it is set to that limit.

Upon comparison of DMW and the sum of base points, it can be determined if the current guess of lambda results in too much generation or too little generation.  In certain situations, units can be removed from further calculations.  This technique improves the performance of the solution.  The positive slope characteristic of the unit ICC's allows this assumption.

The following outline illustrates the solution procedure:

1.0	Initialization
1.1	Make initial guess for solution lambda; determine LMAX and LMIN

The DAM sets prices as of 11:00 A.M. the previous day (thus the term day-ahead) based on generation and energy transaction bids that were offered in advance to the NYISO.  DAM prices are determined on an hourly basis for each of the state's eleven zones and for the four neighboring areas (new England, Hydro Quebec, Ontario Hydro and PJM).  Typically more than 90% of energy transactions processed by NYISO occur in the DAM.  A software program called Scurity Constrained Unit Commitment determines the amount of energy expected to be needed to supply customers' demand and allow a sufficient reserve for contingencies.  The New York Marginal Cost of Energy is the base price that NYISO must pay to obtain the needed energy.  This base price is determined at the NYISO reference bus, so named because it is the reference against which losses, congestion, shift factors, penalty factors and other system mathematical quantities are calculated.  It is physically located at the Marcy 345 kV substation in Marcy, New York.  In transmitting energy across the state, there are additional costs for the electrical losses and sometimes for congestion when transmission lines become overloaded.  The DAM zonal Local Based Marginal Prices are determined by adding the marginal cost of energy, the marginal cost of losses and the marginal cost of congestion.

233,2013,12,0,100,,"Description of Economic Dispatch

Calculation of System lambda

The goal of economic dispatch is to match electric power resources with electricity demand in near real-time on a least incremental cost basis.  For a given system generation requirement, the cheapest operating point occurs where the incremental power cost (lambda) for each controllable unit is equal save any unit limitations.  The mathematical derivation proving the merits of equal lambda dispatch may be found in most power system analysis text books.  The controller must therefore be able to find the right system lambda and the desired generation of each unit at that lambda.

Economic (equal lambda) dispatch at Duke Energy Progress, Inc. is achieved with the use of unit incremental heat-rate curves, fuel costs, emissions costs, variable O&M and penalty factors for transmission losses.  The incremental cost curve for each generating unit is the product of the incremental heat rate curve (that considers emissions per MBTU of heat input) multiplied by the unit fuel cost, augmented by the associated unit’s variable O&M, and then multiplied by the penalty factor to account for transmission losses.  An iterative process of selecting a system lambda target and determining each unit’s MW output at that target until the demand requirement is achieved is constantly employed by the Energy Management System.  As demand changes, a new system lambda is calculated in order to economically match dispatchable generation with the new demand requirement.  The hourly system lambda is subsequently the average of the respective system lambda results from the economic dispatch calculation.  Additionally, each unit’s economical MW output target is further offset in an attempt to maintain an ACE in compliance with applicable NERC Reliability Standards and such as not to be a burden to the Interconnection, thus fulfilling the Balancing Authority requirement.

The power balance constraint is the balance between the ERCOT system load and the amount of generation that is dispatched by its Security Constrained Economic Dispatch (SCED) system to meet that load. ERCOT calculates System Lambda for each 5-minute run of its SCED system. The objective function for SCED is the sum of three components: (1) the cost of dispatching generation, (2) the penalty for violating the power balance constraint, and (3) the penalty for violating network transmission constraints.  The SCED system economically dispatches generation resources by minimizing this objective function within the generator physical limits and transmission limits.

Our thermal resources are dispatched on a monthly or weekly basis, depending upon the season. They are typically base-loaded, providing energy to the system. This thermal energy is then shaped with our controllable hydro-electric generating units. These hydro resources provide essentially our entire load following, and as such, we do not calculate an hourly system lambda.
At the present time, Idaho Power’s computerized economic dispatch function is limited to dispatching hydro units to utilize the maximum amount of water at each plant. Cost information is not a factor in this determination. Load frequency control is performed primarily with generators at only two of our large hydro projects. The balance of our hydro projects are usually operated as either run-of-river or re-regulating plants.

The New York Marginal Cost of Energy is the base price that NYISO must pay to obtain the needed energy.  This base price is determined at the NYISO reference bus, so named because it is the reference against which losses, congestion, shift factors, penalty factors and other system mathematical quantities are calculated.  It is physically located at the Marcy 345 kV substation in Marcy, New York.  In transmitting energy across the state, there are additional costs for the electrical losses and sometimes for congestion when transmission lines become overloaded.  The DAM zonal Local Based Marginal Prices are determined by adding the marginal cost of energy, the marginal cost of losses and the marginal cost of congestion.

The Southern Company system lambda is determined hourly and is based on the variable
costs of the resources that serve the load obligations of the Operating Companies plus any
sales to third parties.  The variable costs of the resources include the components listed
below, and may also reflect the cost of purchases.  The economic dispatch formula used
to dispatch Southern’s generating resources on the basis of their variable cost components
is as follows:

l  =  [ { (  2aP + b ) * ( FC + EC ) } + VOM + FH ] * TPF

	Where:
	l  	= System lambda
	a, b	= Incremental heat rate coefficients
	P	= Generation level
	FC	= Marginal replacement fuel costs
	EC	= Marginal replacement emission allowance costs
	VOM	= Variable operations and maintenance expenses
	FH	= In-plant fuel handling expenses
	TPF	= Incremental transmission losses (penalty factors)",0
116,2014,12,0,100,,"5.5  Economic Allocation - Lambda Dispatch

The Lambda algorithm function determines generator base points and allocates additional reserve to determine new dispatch limits prior to the final base point calculation.

The classical Lambda algorithm solution technique is employed along with additional features that are described below.  The algorithm solution provides a set of generation levels and inverse slopes of the incremental cost curve.  The slope values are later applied for the determination of economic participation factors.

The following notation is used:

P			-	generation MW for a unit being dispatched
Sum p	-	Sum of individual p values being dispatched
DMW	-	total dispatch MW
c			-	generator unit cost curve; c(p) = cost at p output
L			-	Lagrange multiplier whose solution value will be the solution Lambda 

5.5.1  Classical Iterative Approach

The objective of the Lambda algorithm is to find a set of generation p values at minimum total cost for a given desired MW value, DMW:

DMW = SUM p

Since the total cost function is the sum of individual (non-linear) cost functions, the classical Lagrange multiplier method minimizes the augmented cost function F:

F = Sum c(p) + L * (Sum p - PD - TL)

subject to:

MNDP £ p £MXDP

where:	c						-	cost function of generation p
L						-	Lambda (Lagrange multiplier)
PD					-	total system load or demand; constant
TL					-	total transmission losses which is a function of p
MXDP,MNDP	-	given dispatch limits

For the solution set of p values, the term (Sum p - PD - TL) is zero and F will be the minimum total cost.

The minimum of F is determined when each first derivative of F with respect to generator i, df/dp(i), is zero.  The solution criterion is met by the simultaneous solution of the following coordination equations:

(dC(1)/dP(1)) * PF(1) = L
(dC(2)/dP(2)) * PF(2) = L
 .
 .
 .
(dC(n)/dP(n)) * PF(n) = L

where:	dC(i)/dP(i)	-	dc/dp, incremental cost c of unit i at generation level P
PF(i)			-	1/(1 - dTL/dP(i))
-	penalty factor as function of the incremental transmission loss for generator i, dTL/dP(i)
L					-	incremental cost at delivered power, Lambda

These equations state that the incremental cost of delivered power is equal for all dispatched resources.  The penalty factor takes into account the cost of transferring the generated power to the load center.  The penalty factors are assembled by the ED data processing function from one of four sets of penalty factors and entered dispatch (multiplier) factors found in the database.

The MW output of each generator is obtained from its incremental cost curve for the iteration lambda.  If the MW value is outside of the unit dispatch limits, the output is held at the appropriate limit.

5.5.2  Additional Features

Additional features enhance the classical Lambda dispatch algorithm.  These features are:

·	fixing and removing resources from iterations

·	Lambda postulate algorithm

The fixing and removing of units from further iterations is performed when the previous iteration does not converge to the solution.  This process consists of recognizing the over- or under-generating state of the previous iteration pass.  At this point, the units are fixed at their high limits in the under-generating state and removed from the iterative loop, since their dispatch levels would not change in further iterations.  Units are fixed at their low limits in the over-generating state in a similar fashion.

In the Lambda algorithm, the composite slope at the previous lambda from units remaining in the iteration loop is applied as part of the first-order Taylor's approximation of lambda:

L(new) = L(prev) + m' * MWERROR

subject to dynamic high and low lambda limits LMAX and LMIN:

LMIN £ L(new) £ LMAX

where:	m'				-	slope of the composite incremental cost curve
L( )				-	lambda postulate
MWERROR	-	the excess of (over-generation) or lack of (under-generation) dispatch MW's
LMAX		-	L(prev) when L(new) will be smaller
LMIN			-	L(prev) when L(new) will be larger
By constraining L within LMAX and LMIN, a diverging solution is prevented.  If the new L fails the limit test, it is not set to the limit but rather is recomputed by bisection:

L(new) = (LMAX + LMIN)/2

5.5.3  Coordination Equations Solution

The solution of the coordination equations proceeds in an iterative fashion.  The major steps in the solution include:

·	postulation of solution lambda L

·	derivation of unit dispatch MW from the ICC for all units

·	decision as to the necessity for another iteration (by comparing total dispatched MW to total desired MW)

·	fixing and removing resources prior to next iteration

Solution lambda L is initialized by observing resource limits.  The incremental cost LMIN associated with the cheapest resource at its minimum limit and the incremental cost LMAX associated with the most expensive resource at its maximum limit are used in the initial guess of L.  When the previous solution is within these limits, its value is used as L(0); otherwise L(0) is computed by bisection as follows:

L(0) = (LMAX + LMIN)/2

Postulation of lambda between iterations utilizes the slope of the composite incremental cost curve at the current guess of lambda:

L(new) = L(prev) + (DMW-Sum p)/INVSLP

where:	L(new)	-	new guess of lambda
L(prev)	-	previous iteration guess of lambda
INVSLP	-	inverse slope of the composite cost curve at L(prev)
= sum (inverse(unit ICC slopes))
DMW		-	total desired dispatch MW
Sum p		-	sum of base points at previous iteration

Resources are dispatched at the current guess for solution lambda.  Each dispatched MW level is constrained by the unit dispatch limits; when the dispatch level is beyond a limit, it is set to that limit.

Upon comparison of DMW and the sum of base points, it can be determined if the current guess of lambda results in too much generation or too little generation.  In certain situations, units can be removed from further calculations.  This technique improves the performance of the solution.  The positive slope characteristic of the unit ICC's allows this assumption.

The following outline illustrates the solution procedure:

1.0	Initialization
1.1	Make initial guess for solution lambda; determine LMAX and LMIN

-	If unit is dispatched at its minimum dispatch limit, remove the unit from dispatch
-	Else, set the inverse icc slope value
4.3.3	If under-generating state,

Calculation of System lambda

The goal of economic dispatch is to match electric power resources with electricity demand in near real-time on a least incremental cost basis.  For a given system generation requirement, the cheapest operating point occurs where the incremental power cost (lambda) for each controllable unit is equal save any unit limitations.  The mathematical derivation proving the merits of equal lambda dispatch may be found in most power system analysis text books.  The controller must therefore be able to find the right system lambda and the desired generation of each unit at that lambda.

Economic (equal lambda) dispatch at Duke Energy Progress, Inc. is achieved with the use of unit incremental heat-rate curves, fuel costs, emissions costs, variable O&M and penalty factors for transmission losses.  The incremental cost curve for each generating unit is the product of the incremental heat rate curve (that considers emissions per MBTU of heat input) multiplied by the unit fuel cost, augmented by the associated unit’s variable O&M, and then multiplied by the penalty factor to account for transmission losses.  An iterative process of selecting a system lambda target and determining each unit’s MW output at that target until the demand requirement is achieved is constantly employed by the Energy Management System.  As demand changes, a new system lambda is calculated in order to economically match dispatchable generation with the new demand requirement.  The hourly system lambda is subsequently the average of the respective system lambda results from the economic dispatch calculation.  Additionally, each unit’s economical MW output target is further offset in an attempt to maintain an ACE in compliance with applicable NERC Reliability Standards and such as not to be a burden to the Interconnection, thus fulfilling the Balancing Authority requirement.

The process yields the three components of LMPs:

170,2014,12,0,100,,"Economic Dispatch Solution Module (EDSOL)
Given a system total generation requirement, EDSOL determines the most economical generation level for all generators under economic dispatch control, taking into account the generators input-output characteristics, the generators fuel costs and the power losses over the transmission network.
A generating unit's input-output characteristics relate the fuel rate input, MBTU/HR, to the generator's power output (MW). This is usually known as the heat rate curve. The incremental heat rate curve, as the name implies, relates the incremental fuel rate input, MBTU/MWHR, to the generator's power output. Multiplying by the generator's selected fuel's cost, $/MBTU, the generator's incremental cost curve is obtained ($/MWHR vs. MW). The generator's efficiency value (in percent) is also incorporated (by normalization and division) into the determination of the generator's incremental cost curve coefficients. The incremental heat rate curve is linearized and defined by up to eighteen straight- line segments. Each segment is defined by its two end points.
Mathematically, the economic dispatch problem can be expressed as the minimization of the generation cost, which is defined as:
	C = S ci (Pi)						(1)
Where
	C	=	generation cost
	Pi	=	output power of generator i
	ci (Pi)	=	fuel cost for Pi
Subject to the following constraints:
	Pmini £ Pi £ Pmaxi					(2)
	S Pi = Load + Loss (P1. Pi, ...)			(3)
Where
	Pmini	=	minimum power of generator i
	Pmaxi	=	maximum power of generator i
	Load	=	system load
	Loss	=	line losses
Now, consider the augmented Lagrange cost function:
	£ = C - l (S Pi - Load - Loss)				(4)
The optimal solution is given by:
	¶£ = 0
	¶Pi							(5)

i.e.,	¶Ci (Pi)      -      l (1 - ¶ Loss)   = 0
	  ¶ Pi                             ¶ Pi
Which gives the optimal coordination equations:
	l = Pfi    ¶Ci (Pi)						(6)
                                       ¶Pi
Where
	Pfi   =       1      		is the penalty factor of generator i.
                  1 - ¶ Loss
                        ¶ Pi
Equation (6) shows that the optimal dispatch is achieved when all generators operate at equal incremental cost l.
Calculating the penalty factors Pfi, which are a measure of transmission losses, requires the solution of load flow equations.
The Economic Dispatch Solution routine's (EDSOL's) caller normally obtains the penalty factors from the database as calculated by Network Analysis. They can alternately be set by the user or set to unity (1.0).
Any Power Application that provides the appropriate set of input data can utilize EDSOL routine. The caller can optionally direct EDSOL to obtain certain input data, such as generators incremental heat rate curves coefficients and generators fuel selections and costs, directly from the appropriate database tables.
EDSOL begins its processing by adjusting the caller's total required generation to reflect the outputs available from off-control or from base loaded generators. The adjusted value is EDSOL's total required generation from among the economically dispatched generators. In the case of the Economic Dispatch Control (EDC) calling EDSOL, EDSOL develops its total required generation by summing the current actual MW outputs of the economically dispatched generators.
If EDSOL finds that its total required generation can not be satisfied due to being out of range of the EDC High or EDC Low limits sum, then each dispatched generator's desired generation value is set equal to the appropriate EDC limit before returning to the caller. EDSOL also returns the appropriate solution status indication, which the caller can check to detect and possibly act upon (such as by alerting the dispatcher or user) the situation.
EDSOL develops each dispatched generator's incremental cost curve coefficients, as described above, and determines the system's maximum and minimum possible values of Lambda as the initial bounds of the iterative Lambda search.
The set of simultaneous equations described above is solved iteratively by establishing a trial value of Lambda to calculate each dispatched generator's desired power output and the system sum of the desired power outputs. If the system sum of the desired power outputs matches (within a designated tolerance) EDSOL's total required generation, then the iterative Lambda search terminates. Otherwise, the trial value of Lambda is adjusted (using a binary search protected Newton's method adjustment) and another iteration's calculations are performed. The output of the terminated Lambda search is a tentative set of desired output values that are within the generators EDC High and EDC Low limits and will satisfy EDSOL's total required generation.
Each generator's tentative desired output is checked against the generator's designated and calculated disallowed regions. If one or more generator's tentative desired output is found to be within a disallowed region, then one such generator is selected to have its desired output subsequently clamped to the appropriate edge of the disallowed region. With that generator effectively removed from the solution calculations, EDSOL returns to again perform the iterative Lambda search among the reduced set of economically dispatched generators, and then again check for the need to move a generator's desired output value out of a disallowed region.
The disallowed regions check loop is terminated once EDSOL finds that no generator's desired output lies within a disallowed region.
If it is not possible to find a closely matching economic dispatch solution (the designated or calculated disallowed regions cause the economic dispatch solution problem to be excessively constrained), then EDSOL returns the appropriate solution status indication to the caller.
EDSOL returns to the caller the calculated value of Lambda and the set of desired outputs for the economically dispatched generators.

METHOD OF CALCULATION

The coordination equations to be solved by EDC are:

(CJ * df/dpj + Imj) * PFj = LAMBDA

Where:  Cj	     = Fuel cost for the jth unit.

             dfj/dpj         = Incremental heat rate for the jth unit.

             IMj               = Incremental maintenance cost for the jth unit.

             PFj               = Penalty Factor for the jth unit.

Part II - Schedule 6.  Control Area System Lambda Data
Description of Economic Dispatch - System Lambda


Duke’s approach to economic dispatch involves the iterative process of evaluating system incremental costs, unit generation levels, and system load requirements.  The theory behind economic dispatch is to operate the generation units at an equal incremental cost (adjusted for transmission losses) to minimize system costs.  The process is conceptually described as follows:
Select a system incremental cost to evaluate based on system load requirements.
Use the selected system incremental cost to calculate unit incremental costs using unit penalty factors.  Unit penalty factors relate unit generation levels to system transmission losses.
Calculate unit generation levels using the unit incremental cost and unit incremental cost curves.
Sum up unit generation levels to get system generation.
Compare system generation to system load requirements.
If system generation is less than system load requirements, select a new system incremental cost that is greater than the previous system incremental cost.  If system generation is greater than system load requirement, select a new system incremental cost that is less than the previous system incremental cost.
Return to step 2 and continue the process.

Once system generation equals the system load requirements (within a small deadband), the economic dispatch process is complete.  The last system incremental cost is system lambda, and the last unit generation levels are the optimal generation levels.",0

Description of PNM Balancing Authority Economic Dispatch

PNM Balancing Authority Economic Dispatch 

Since there are no agreements for PNM economic dispatch of non-PNM generation resources within the PNM Balancing Authority, each utility within the PNM Balancing Authority independently performs economic dispatch of their own generation resources.  The majority of PNM Balancing Authority generation resources belong to PNM.  PNM generation resources are economically dispatched as follows:

PNM purchases under long term PPA (Prior Purchase Adjustment), the entire output of the Taiban Mesa Wind Farm (204 MWs)  This resource is dispatched as must take.

PNM Palo Verde nuclear generation is the lowest cost PNM generation resource.  It is also very undesirable to curtail Palo Verde nuclear generation from a plant operations perspective.  Therefore, PNM Palo Verde generation is always run at its full capability. 

PNM San Juan generation is typically the next lowest cost PNM generation resource.  That generation is on Automatic Generation Control to follow swings in PNM area control error (ACE).   PNM ownership of San Juan units is spread over four units.  PNM's Energy Management System (EMS) is equipped with an economic dispatch function.  

PNM Four Corners generation is usually PNM's next resource in the dispatch stack.  It does not provide AGC. It is typically fully loaded, except when the spot market is lower than the Four Corners incremental cost.    

PNM owns one third of the Luna Energy Facility.  This is a two on one combined cycle gas unit with an optimum heat rate of 7200.  This Luna unit is on Automatic Generation Control (AGC) and is dispatched in economic basis.

PNM owns 100% of the Afton Power Plant.  This plant is a one on one combined cycle gas plant with an optimum heat rate of 7200.

Lordsburg Generating Station is two gas only turbines located in southern New Mexico, owned and operated by PNM.  It is started for load, regulation or for spinning reserves resources, provided transmission is purchased to the delivery point, and for energy sales, if its operating costs are within the range of spot market costs.

PNM Reeves is a gas plant located in Albuquerque.  It is started for load, for spinning reserves resources, for loadside used for transmission support, and for energy sales, if its operating costs are within the range of spot market costs.

Valencia is a gas plant located south of Albuquerque.  Its total output is purchased by PNM.  It is started for load, for reserves, for load side used for transmission support, to support conditional firm transmission sales, and for energy sales.  It is typically dispatched after Reeves and before Delta.  However, Valencia can come online much more quickly than Reeves, so in the event of a unit trip, Valencia may be brought online instead of Reeves.  

Delta-Person is a gas/oil plant located in Albuquerque.  It is owned and operated by PNM and is dispatched economically, usually after Valencia generation. When on line, Delta-Person is on Automatic Generation Control to follow swings in PNM area control error (ACE).  It is started for load, to support conditional firm transmission sales, or for loadside used for transmission support.  It can also be brought online to recover from a unit trip; in such cases it may be brought online before Reeves or Valencia. 

PNM owns a total of 66 MWs of Solar generation that were added to PNM’s renewable generation portfolio.  The Facilities are geographically dispersed throughout PNM’s Balancing Authority area.  While these resources are not economically dispatched, they are included in daily unit commitments.

PNM System Lambda Calculation

Since PNM is not able to economically dispatch non-PNM Balancing Authority generation resources, the System Lambda calculation only includes PNM generation resources.  If generation resources having an incremental fuel cost less than the calculated San Juan lambda are being curtailed, the PNM Real Time Power Trader manually schedules the lower cost resource to replace the higher lambda San Juan resource.  The calculated San Juan lambda value is manually replaced with the lower value.  If the PNM San Juan generation resource is fully scheduled, except for unloaded capacity needed for regulation and spinning reserves, and PNM is using generation resources having a higher incremental fuel cost (such as purchased energy with a higher cost than the San Juan lambda), the PNM Real Time Power Trader replaces the previously calculated lambda value with the cost of the next incremental generation resource available to PNM.

The Economic Dispatch function uses generator performance curves to allocate generation in the most economic manner for those units that are in the economic dispatch mode.  As Seattle’s generators and plants on the Skagit project are not hydraulically matched and there are seasonal flow constraints for fish protection, not all units can be operated in the economic dispatch mode. Seattle normally strives to fully utilize its hydro storage and peaking capability at both its Boundary and Skagit Projects.  During the light load hours, we normally take in lower priced energy into our system, operate our Skagit Project to near minimum license requirements (fish flow minimum), and completely shut down our Boundary Project.

During the hour, the generation levels at TID units are varied to meet the actual minute to minute variations in load.  In addition, the generation resources are adjusted to meet other operating criteria such as required water flows, required reserves, and environmental limitations at units.

More often than not, a significant change in load (a change that would be relflected in our forecasted load for the next clock hour) would result in a change in wholesale puchases or sales.

It is physically located at the Marcy 345 kV substation in Marcy, New York.  In transmitting energy across the state, there are additional costs for the electrical losses and sometimes for congestion when transmission lines become overloaded.

The mathematical derivation proving the merits of equal lambda dispatch may be found in most power system analysis text books.  The controller must therefore be able to find the right system lambda and the desired generation of each unit at that lambda.

Economic (equal lambda) dispatch at Duke Energy Progress, LLC is achieved with the use of unit incremental heat-rate curves, fuel costs, emissions cost, variable O&M and penalty factors for transmission losses.  The incremental cost curve for each generating unit is the product of the incremental heat rate curve (that considers emissions per MBTU of heat input) multiplied by the unit fuel cost, augmented by the associated unit's variable O&M, and then multiplied by the penalty factor to account for transmission losses.  An iterative process of selecting a system lambda target and determining each unit's MW output at that target until the demand requirement is achieved is constantly employed by the Energy Management System.  As demand changes, a new system lambda is calculated in order to economically match dispatchable generation with the new demand requirement.  The hourly system lambda is subsequently the average of the respective system lambda results from the economic dispatch calculation.  Additionally, each unit's economical MW output target is further offset in an attempt to maintain an ACE in compliance with applicable NERC Reliability Standards and such as not to be a burden to the Interconnection, thus fulfilling the Balancing Authority requirement.",0

Description of PNM Balancing Authority Economic Dispatch

PNM Balancing Authority Economic Dispatch 

Since there are no agreements for PNM economic dispatch of non-PNM generation resources within the PNM Balancing Authority, each utility within the PNM Balancing Authority independently performs economic dispatch of their own generation resources.  The majority of PNM Balancing Authority generation resources belong to PNM.  PNM generation resources are economically dispatched as follows:

PNM purchases under long term PPA (Prior Purchase Adjustment), the entire output of the Taiban Mesa Wind Farm (204 MWs) and the Red Mesa Wind farm (100MWs) This resource is dispatched as must take.

PNM Palo Verde nuclear generation is the lowest cost PNM generation resource.  It is also very undesirable to curtail Palo Verde nuclear generation from a plant operations perspective.  Therefore, PNM Palo Verde generation is always run at its full capability. 

PNM San Juan generation is typically the next lowest cost PNM generation resource.  That generation is on Automatic Generation Control to follow swings in PNM area control error (ACE).   PNM ownership of San Juan units is spread over four units.  PNM's Energy Management System (EMS) is equipped with an economic dispatch function.  

PNM Four Corners generation is usually PNM's next resource in the dispatch stack.  It does not provide AGC. It is typically fully loaded, except when the spot market is lower than the Four Corners incremental cost.    

PNM owns one third of the Luna Energy Facility.  This is a two on one combined cycle gas unit with an optimum heat rate of 7200.  This Luna unit is on Automatic Generation Control (AGC) and is dispatched in economic basis.

PNM owns 100% of the Afton Power Plant.  This plant is a one on one combined cycle gas plant with an optimum heat rate of 7200.

Lordsburg Generating Station is two gas only turbines located in southern New Mexico, owned and operated by PNM.  It is started for load, regulation or for spinning reserves resources, provided transmission is purchased to the delivery point, and for energy sales, if its operating costs are within the range of spot market costs.

La Luz plant is located in northern New Mexico, owned and operated by PNM.  It is the same technology as the Lordsburg plants and is used in the same manner.

PNM Reeves is a gas plant located in Albuquerque.  It is started for load, for spinning reserves resources, for loadside used for transmission support, and for energy sales, if its operating costs are within the range of spot market costs.

Valencia is a gas plant located south of Albuquerque.  Its total output is purchased by PNM.  It is started for load, for reserves, for load side used for transmission support, to support conditional firm transmission sales, and for energy sales.  It is typically dispatched after Reeves and before Delta.  However, Valencia can come online much more quickly than Reeves, so in the event of a unit trip, Valencia may be brought online instead of Reeves.  

Rio Bravo is a gas/oil plant located in Albuquerque.  It is owned and operated by PNM and is dispatched economically, usually after Valencia generation. When on line, Delta-Person is on Automatic Generation Control to follow swings in PNM area control error (ACE).  It is started for load, to support conditional firm transmission sales, or for loadside used for transmission support.  It can also be brought online to recover from a unit trip; in such cases it may be brought online before Reeves or Valencia. 

PNM owns a total of 100 MWs of Solar generation that were added to PNM’s renewable generation portfolio.  The Facilities are geographically dispersed throughout PNM’s Balancing Authority area.  While these resources are not economically dispatched, they are included in daily unit commitments.

PNM System Lambda Calculation

Since PNM is not able to economically dispatch non-PNM Balancing Authority generation resources, the System Lambda calculation only includes PNM generation resources.  If generation resources having an incremental fuel cost less than the calculated San Juan lambda are being curtailed, the PNM Real Time Power Trader manually schedules the lower cost resource to replace the higher lambda San Juan resource.  The calculated San Juan lambda value is manually replaced with the lower value.  If the PNM San Juan generation resource is fully scheduled, except for unloaded capacity needed for regulation and spinning reserves, and PNM is using generation resources having a higher incremental fuel cost (such as purchased energy with a higher cost than the San Juan lambda), the PNM Real Time Power Trader replaces the previously calculated lambda value with the cost of the next incremental generation resource available to PNM.

116,2015,12,0,100,,"5.5  Economic Allocation - Lambda Dispatch

The Lambda algorithm function determines generator base points and allocates additional reserve to determine new dispatch limits prior to the final base point calculation.

The classical Lambda algorithm solution technique is employed along with additional features that are described below.  The algorithm solution provides a set of generation levels and inverse slopes of the incremental cost curve.  The slope values are later applied for the determination of economic participation factors.

The following notation is used:

P			-	generation MW for a unit being dispatched
Sum p	-	Sum of individual p values being dispatched
DMW	-	total dispatch MW
c			-	generator unit cost curve; c(p) = cost at p output
L			-	Lagrange multiplier whose solution value will be the solution Lambda 

5.5.1  Classical Iterative Approach

The objective of the Lambda algorithm is to find a set of generation p values at minimum total cost for a given desired MW value, DMW:

DMW = SUM p

Since the total cost function is the sum of individual (non-linear) cost functions, the classical Lagrange multiplier method minimizes the augmented cost function F:

F = Sum c(p) + L * (Sum p - PD - TL)

subject to:

MNDP £ p £MXDP

where:	c						-	cost function of generation p
L						-	Lambda (Lagrange multiplier)
PD					-	total system load or demand; constant
TL					-	total transmission losses which is a function of p
MXDP,MNDP	-	given dispatch limits

For the solution set of p values, the term (Sum p - PD - TL) is zero and F will be the minimum total cost.

The minimum of F is determined when each first derivative of F with respect to generator i, df/dp(i), is zero.  The solution criterion is met by the simultaneous solution of the following coordination equations:

(dC(1)/dP(1)) * PF(1) = L
(dC(2)/dP(2)) * PF(2) = L
 .
 .
 .
(dC(n)/dP(n)) * PF(n) = L

where:	dC(i)/dP(i)	-	dc/dp, incremental cost c of unit i at generation level P
PF(i)			-	1/(1 - dTL/dP(i))
-	penalty factor as function of the incremental transmission loss for generator i, dTL/dP(i)
L					-	incremental cost at delivered power, Lambda

These equations state that the incremental cost of delivered power is equal for all dispatched resources.  The penalty factor takes into account the cost of transferring the generated power to the load center.  The penalty factors are assembled by the ED data processing function from one of four sets of penalty factors and entered dispatch (multiplier) factors found in the database.

The MW output of each generator is obtained from its incremental cost curve for the iteration lambda.  If the MW value is outside of the unit dispatch limits, the output is held at the appropriate limit.

5.5.2  Additional Features

Additional features enhance the classical Lambda dispatch algorithm.  These features are:

·	fixing and removing resources from iterations

·	Lambda postulate algorithm

The fixing and removing of units from further iterations is performed when the previous iteration does not converge to the solution.  This process consists of recognizing the over- or under-generating state of the previous iteration pass.  At this point, the units are fixed at their high limits in the under-generating state and removed from the iterative loop, since their dispatch levels would not change in further iterations.  Units are fixed at their low limits in the over-generating state in a similar fashion.

In the Lambda algorithm, the composite slope at the previous lambda from units remaining in the iteration loop is applied as part of the first-order Taylor's approximation of lambda:

L(new) = L(prev) + m' * MWERROR

subject to dynamic high and low lambda limits LMAX and LMIN:

LMIN £ L(new) £ LMAX

where:	m'				-	slope of the composite incremental cost curve
L( )				-	lambda postulate
MWERROR	-	the excess of (over-generation) or lack of (under-generation) dispatch MW's
LMAX		-	L(prev) when L(new) will be smaller
LMIN			-	L(prev) when L(new) will be larger
By constraining L within LMAX and LMIN, a diverging solution is prevented.  If the new L fails the limit test, it is not set to the limit but rather is recomputed by bisection:

L(new) = (LMAX + LMIN)/2

5.5.3  Coordination Equations Solution

The solution of the coordination equations proceeds in an iterative fashion.  The major steps in the solution include:

·	postulation of solution lambda L

·	derivation of unit dispatch MW from the ICC for all units

·	decision as to the necessity for another iteration (by comparing total dispatched MW to total desired MW)

·	fixing and removing resources prior to next iteration

Solution lambda L is initialized by observing resource limits.  The incremental cost LMIN associated with the cheapest resource at its minimum limit and the incremental cost LMAX associated with the most expensive resource at its maximum limit are used in the initial guess of L.  When the previous solution is within these limits, its value is used as L(0); otherwise L(0) is computed by bisection as follows:

L(0) = (LMAX + LMIN)/2

Postulation of lambda between iterations utilizes the slope of the composite incremental cost curve at the current guess of lambda:

L(new) = L(prev) + (DMW-Sum p)/INVSLP

where:	L(new)	-	new guess of lambda
L(prev)	-	previous iteration guess of lambda
INVSLP	-	inverse slope of the composite cost curve at L(prev)
= sum (inverse(unit ICC slopes))
DMW		-	total desired dispatch MW
Sum p		-	sum of base points at previous iteration

Resources are dispatched at the current guess for solution lambda.  Each dispatched MW level is constrained by the unit dispatch limits; when the dispatch level is beyond a limit, it is set to that limit.

Upon comparison of DMW and the sum of base points, it can be determined if the current guess of lambda results in too much generation or too little generation.  In certain situations, units can be removed from further calculations.  This technique improves the performance of the solution.  The positive slope characteristic of the unit ICC's allows this assumption.

The following outline illustrates the solution procedure:

170,2015,12,0,100,,"Economic Dispatch Solution Module (EDSOL)
Given a system total generation requirement, EDSOL determines the most economical generation level for all
generators under economic dispatch control, taking into account the generators input-output characteristics,
the generators fuel costs and the power losses over the transmission network.
A generating unit's input-output characteristics relate the fuel rate input, MBTU/HR, to the generator's power
output (MW). This is usually known as the heat rate curve. The incremental heat rate curve, as the name
implies, relates the incremental fuel rate input, MBTU/MWHR, to the generator's power output. Multiplying by
the generator's selected fuel's cost, $/MBTU, the generator's incremental cost curve is obtained ($/MWHR vs.
MW). The generator's efficiency value (in percent) is also incorporated (by normalization and division) into the
determination of the generator's incremental cost curve coefficients. The incremental heat rate curve is
linearized and defined by up to eighteen straight- line segments. Each segment is defined by its two end
points.
Mathematically, the economic dispatch problem can be expressed as the minimization of the generation cost,
which is defined as:
C = S ci (Pi) (1)
Where
C = generation cost
Pi = output power of generator i
ci (Pi) = fuel cost for Pi
Subject to the following constraints:
Pmini £ Pi £ Pmaxi (2)
S Pi = Load + Loss (P1. Pi, ...) (3)
Where
Pmini = minimum power of generator i
Pmaxi = maximum power of generator i
Load = system load
Loss = line losses
Now, consider the augmented Lagrange cost function:
£ = C - l (S Pi - Load - Loss) (4)
The optimal solution is given by:
¶£ = 0
¶Pi (5)
i.e., ¶Ci (Pi) - l (1 - ¶ Loss) = 0
¶ Pi ¶ Pi
Which gives the optimal coordination equations:
l = Pfi ¶Ci (Pi) (6)
¶Pi
Where
Pfi = 1 is the penalty factor of generator i.
1 - ¶ Loss
¶ Pi
Equation (6) shows that the optimal dispatch is achieved when all generators operate at equal incremental
cost l.
Calculating the penalty factors Pfi, which are a measure of transmission losses, requires the solution of load
flow equations.
The Economic Dispatch Solution routine's (EDSOL's) caller normally obtains the penalty factors from the
database as calculated by Network Analysis. They can alternately be set by the user or set to unity (1.0).
Any Power Application that provides the appropriate set of input data can utilize EDSOL routine. The caller
can optionally direct EDSOL to obtain certain input data, such as generators incremental heat rate curves
coefficients and generators fuel selections and costs, directly from the appropriate database tables.
EDSOL begins its processing by adjusting the caller's total required generation to reflect the outputs available
from off-control or from base loaded generators. The adjusted value is EDSOL's total required generation
from among the economically dispatched generators. In the case of the Economic Dispatch Control (EDC)
calling EDSOL, EDSOL develops its total required generation by summing the current actual MW outputs of
the economically dispatched generators.
If EDSOL finds that its total required generation can not be satisfied due to being out of range of the EDC High
or EDC Low limits sum, then each dispatched generator's desired generation value is set equal to the
appropriate EDC limit before returning to the caller. EDSOL also returns the appropriate solution status
indication, which the caller can check to detect and possibly act upon (such as by alerting the dispatcher or
user) the situation.
EDSOL develops each dispatched generator's incremental cost curve coefficients, as described above, and
determines the system's maximum and minimum possible values of Lambda as the initial bounds of the
iterative Lambda search.
The set of simultaneous equations described above is solved iteratively by establishing a trial value of Lambda
to calculate each dispatched generator's desired power output and the system sum of the desired power
outputs. If the system sum of the desired power outputs matches (within a designated tolerance) EDSOL's
total required generation, then the iterative Lambda search terminates. Otherwise, the trial value of Lambda is
adjusted (using a binary search protected Newton's method adjustment) and another iteration's calculations
are performed. The output of the terminated Lambda search is a tentative set of desired output values that are
within the generators EDC High and EDC Low limits and will satisfy EDSOL's total required generation.
Each generator's tentative desired output is checked against the generator's designated and calculated
disallowed regions. If one or more generator's tentative desired output is found to be within a disallowed
region, then one such generator is selected to have its desired output subsequently clamped to the
appropriate edge of the disallowed region. With that generator effectively removed from the solution
calculations, EDSOL returns to again perform the iterative Lambda search among the reduced set of
economically dispatched generators, and then again check for the need to move a generator's desired output
value out of a disallowed region.
The disallowed regions check loop is terminated once EDSOL finds that no generator's desired output lies
within a disallowed region.
If it is not possible to find a closely matching economic dispatch solution (the designated or calculated
disallowed regions cause the economic dispatch solution problem to be excessively constrained), then
EDSOL returns the appropriate solution status indication to the caller.
EDSOL returns to the caller the calculated value of Lambda and the set of desired outputs for the
economically dispatched generators. Other data is also made available for the caller, such as the solution's
status indication (Normal In Range Solution, Constrained By EDC High Limits Sum, etc.), a list of the indices
of the economically dispatched generators and the set of calculated (pseudo) disallowed regions to be avoided
to limit the starting or stopping of mills.",0

METHOD OF CALCULATION

The coordination equations to be solved by EDC are:

(CJ * df/dpj + Imj) * PFj = LAMBDA

Where:  Cj	     = Fuel cost for the jth unit.

             dfj/dpj         = Incremental heat rate for the jth unit.

             IMj               = Incremental maintenance cost for the jth unit.

             PFj               = Penalty Factor for the jth unit.
                                     Used to bias entire unit cost.

             LAMBDA     = Incremental cost of supplying power to a hypothetical load center of the 
                                      area.

In addition to the coordination equations, the following power balance equation must be satisfied:

SUM OF    Basepoints of                                                             
                   dispatched                        =  SUM OF                    Actual generation of dispatched 
                   generation                                                                units (at beginning of dispatch)
                   (at end of dispatch)


                                               + SUM OF                     rate-limited difference between
                                                                                      base points and current generation  
                                                                                      of units on ramp, base load, or base
                                                                                      load and regulating


                                                + DG

Where: DG is normally FACE, but is limited to the maximum MW all units on control may move 
             during the interval between EDC executions.  DG always has the same sign as FACE.






The EDC routine consists of an inner and outer loop.  The inner loop is a binary search routine for solving the coordination equations in order to obtain base points for a fixed value of LAMBDA.

During this solution it is necessary, of course, to recognize the high and low economic limits and the calculated high and low rate limits.  Once the base points have been determined an outer loop calculation is made to see if the power balance equation is satisfied.  If not, LAMBDA is adjusted, the inner loop is then reentered and a new set of base points calculated.

This procedure will continue until one of these conditions is met:

Both the coordination equations and the power balance equation are satisfied to within
specified tolerances.

2.     Either the coordination equations or the power balance equation does not converse because of    
        numerical or physical problems.  In this case a message is sent to the system console.


Assuming that a valid solution is obtained, the economic participation factors are computed for those units, which are to follow load.  The base points and economic participation factors (for the load following units) are then updated for use by the AGC routines.  The economic participation factors for the units which are not load following are set to zero.

Economic participation factors are calculated by assuming that the slope of the LAMBDA versus generation curve is constant over a short range.  The load is increased by a percentage, DELEDC, and a new dispatch is made.  Economic participation factors for load above the sum of base points are then calculated:

UEPFUPj   =   (change in unitj generation)/
                         (change in system load)

The load is then decreased to the same percentage below its original value, and a new dispatch is made.  Economic participation factors for load below the sum of base points are calculated in the same way as the increasing ones.

EDC utilizes the Auto-Ranging Binary Search method.  It operates by dividing the search region into two, deciding which half the desired result is in, dividing that half into two, and so on until a solution is obtained.  Starting with the desired generation DESGEN (= sum of all generation from telemetry  +  FACE) and an initial value of LAMBDA (usually the value from the last EDC), the calculation proceeds until the error (MWn-DESGEN) is less than a set fraction of DESGEN.  This fraction, ERRTPW, resides in the database.

The binary search algorithm will always work for the Economic Dispatch Calculation when given a realistic set of conditions.  Discontinuous heat rate curve is also supported.  Discontinuous curves have slopes that are infinite at certain points.

Part II - Schedule 6.  Control Area System Lambda Data
Description of Economic Dispatch - System Lambda


Duke’s approach to economic dispatch involves the iterative process of evaluating system incremental costs, unit generation levels, and system load requirements.  The theory behind economic dispatch is to operate the generation units at an equal incremental cost (adjusted for transmission losses) to minimize system costs.  The process is conceptually described as follows:

1.    Select a system incremental cost to evaluate based on system load requirements.
2.    Use the selected system incremental cost to calculate unit incremental costs using unit penalty factors.  Unit
       penalty factors relate unit generation levels to system transmission losses.
3.    Calculate unit generation levels using the unit incremental cost and unit incremental cost curves.
4.    Sum up unit generation levels to get system generation.
5.    Compare system generation to system load requirements.
6.    If system generation is less than system load requirements, select a new system incremental cost that is greater
       than the previous system incremental cost.  If system generation is greater than system load requirement, select a
       new system incremental cost that is less than the previous system incremental cost.
7.    Return to step 2 and continue the process.

Once system generation equals the system load requirements (within a small deadband), the economic dispatch process is complete.  The last system incremental cost is system lambda, and the last unit generation levels are the optimal generation levels.

Description of PNM Balancing Authority Economic Dispatch

PNM Balancing Authority Economic Dispatch 

Since there are no agreements for PNM economic dispatch of non-PNM generation resources within the PNM Balancing Authority, each utility within the PNM Balancing Authority independently performs economic dispatch of their own generation resources.  The majority of PNM Balancing Authority generation resources belong to PNM.  PNM generation resources are economically dispatched as follows:

PNM purchases under long term PPA (Prior Purchase Adjustment), the entire output of the Taiban Mesa Wind Farm (204 MWs) and the Red Mesa Wind farm (100MWs). This resource is dispatched as must take.

PNM Palo Verde nuclear generation is the lowest cost PNM generation resource.  It is also very undesirable to curtail Palo Verde nuclear generation from a plant operations perspective.  Therefore, PNM Palo Verde generation is always run at its full capability. 

PNM San Juan generation is typically the next lowest cost PNM generation resource.  That generation is on Automatic Generation Control to follow swings in PNM area control error (ACE).   PNM ownership of San Juan units is spread over four units.  PNM's Energy Management System (EMS) is equipped with an economic dispatch function.  

PNM Four Corners generation is usually PNM's next resource in the dispatch stack.  It does not provide AGC. It is typically fully loaded, except when the spot market is lower than the Four Corners incremental cost.    

PNM owns one third of the Luna Energy Facility.  This is a two on one combined cycle gas unit with an optimum heat rate of 7200.  This Luna unit is on Automatic Generation Control (AGC) and is dispatched in economic basis.

PNM owns 100% of the Afton Power Plant.  This plant is a one on one combined cycle gas plant with an optimum heat rate of 7200.

Lordsburg Generating Station is two gas only turbines located in southern New Mexico, owned and operated by PNM.  It is started for load, regulation or for spinning reserves resources, provided transmission is purchased to the delivery point, and for energy sales, if its operating costs are within the range of spot market costs.

La Luz plant is located in northern New Mexico, owned and operated by PNM.  It is the same technology as the Lordsburg plants and is used in the same manner.

PNM Reeves is a gas plant located in Albuquerque.  It is started for load, for spinning reserves resources, for loadside used for transmission support, and for energy sales, if its operating costs are within the range of spot market costs.

Valencia is a gas plant located south of Albuquerque.  Its total output is purchased by PNM.  It is started for load, for reserves, for load side used for transmission support, and for energy sales.  It is typically dispatched after Reeves and before Rio Bravo.  However, Valencia can come online much more quickly than Reeves, so in the event of a unit trip, Valencia may be brought online instead of Reeves.  

Rio Bravo is a gas/oil plant located in Albuquerque.  It is owned and operated by PNM and is dispatched economically, usually after Valencia generation. When on line, Delta-Person is on Automatic Generation Control to follow swings in PNM area control error (ACE).  It is started for load or for loadside used for transmission support.  It can also be brought online to recover from a unit trip; in such cases it may be brought online before Reeves or Valencia. 

PNM owns over 100 MWs of Solar generation that were added to PNM’s renewable generation portfolio.  The Facilities are geographically dispersed throughout PNM’s Balancing Authority area.  While these resources are not economically dispatched, they are included in daily unit commitments.

PNM System Lambda Calculation

Since PNM is not able to economically dispatch non-PNM Balancing Authority generation resources, the System Lambda calculation only includes PNM generation resources.  If generation resources having an incremental fuel cost less than the calculated San Juan lambda are being curtailed, the PNM Real Time Power Trader manually schedules the lower cost resource to replace the higher lambda San Juan resource.  The calculated San Juan lambda value is manually replaced with the lower value.  If the PNM San Juan generation resource is fully scheduled, except for unloaded capacity needed for regulation and spinning reserves, and PNM is using generation resources having a higher incremental fuel cost (such as purchased energy with a higher cost than the San Juan lambda), the PNM Real Time Power Trader replaces the previously calculated lambda value with the cost of the next incremental generation resource available to PNM.

The Lambda algorithm function determines generator base points and allocates additional reserve to determine new dispatch limits prior to the final base point calculation.

The classical Lambda algorithm solution technique is employed along with additional features that are described below.  The algorithm solution provides a set of generation levels and inverse slopes of the incremental cost curve.  The slope values are later applied for the determination of economic participation factors.

The following notation is used:

P			-	generation MW for a unit being dispatched
Sum p	-	Sum of individual p values being dispatched
DMW	-	total dispatch MW
c			-	generator unit cost curve; c(p) = cost at p output
L			-	Lagrange multiplier whose solution value will be the solution Lambda 

5.5.1  Classical Iterative Approach

The objective of the Lambda algorithm is to find a set of generation p values at minimum total cost for a given desired MW value, DMW:

DMW = SUM p

Since the total cost function is the sum of individual (non-linear) cost functions, the classical Lagrange multiplier method minimizes the augmented cost function F:

F = Sum c(p) + L * (Sum p - PD - TL)

subject to:

MNDP £ p £MXDP

where:	c						-	cost function of generation p
L						-	Lambda (Lagrange multiplier)
PD					-	total system load or demand; constant
TL					-	total transmission losses which is a function of p
MXDP,MNDP	-	given dispatch limits

For the solution set of p values, the term (Sum p - PD - TL) is zero and F will be the minimum total cost.

The minimum of F is determined when each first derivative of F with respect to generator i, df/dp(i), is zero.  The solution criterion is met by the simultaneous solution of the following coordination equations:

(dC(1)/dP(1)) * PF(1) = L
(dC(2)/dP(2)) * PF(2) = L
 .
 .
 .
(dC(n)/dP(n)) * PF(n) = L

where:	dC(i)/dP(i)	-	dc/dp, incremental cost c of unit i at generation level P
PF(i)			-	1/(1 - dTL/dP(i))
-	penalty factor as function of the incremental transmission loss for generator i, dTL/dP(i)
L					-	incremental cost at delivered power, Lambda

These equations state that the incremental cost of delivered power is equal for all dispatched resources.  The penalty factor takes into account the cost of transferring the generated power to the load center.  The penalty factors are assembled by the ED data processing function from one of four sets of penalty factors and entered dispatch (multiplier) factors found in the database.

The MW output of each generator is obtained from its incremental cost curve for the iteration lambda.  If the MW value is outside of the unit dispatch limits, the output is held at the appropriate limit.

5.5.2  Additional Features

Additional features enhance the classical Lambda dispatch algorithm.  These features are:

·	fixing and removing resources from iterations

·	Lambda postulate algorithm

The fixing and removing of units from further iterations is performed when the previous iteration does not converge to the solution.  This process consists of recognizing the over- or under-generating state of the previous iteration pass.  At this point, the units are fixed at their high limits in the under-generating state and removed from the iterative loop, since their dispatch levels would not change in further iterations.  Units are fixed at their low limits in the over-generating state in a similar fashion.

In the Lambda algorithm, the composite slope at the previous lambda from units remaining in the iteration loop is applied as part of the first-order Taylor's approximation of lambda:

L(new) = L(prev) + m' * MWERROR

subject to dynamic high and low lambda limits LMAX and LMIN:

LMIN £ L(new) £ LMAX

where:	m'				-	slope of the composite incremental cost curve
L( )				-	lambda postulate
MWERROR	-	the excess of (over-generation) or lack of (under-generation) dispatch MW's
LMAX		-	L(prev) when L(new) will be smaller
LMIN			-	L(prev) when L(new) will be larger
By constraining L within LMAX and LMIN, a diverging solution is prevented.  If the new L fails the limit test, it is not set to the limit but rather is recomputed by bisection:

L(new) = (LMAX + LMIN)/2

5.5.3  Coordination Equations Solution

The solution of the coordination equations proceeds in an iterative fashion.  The major steps in the solution include:

·	postulation of solution lambda L

·	derivation of unit dispatch MW from the ICC for all units

·	decision as to the necessity for another iteration (by comparing total dispatched MW to total desired MW)

·	fixing and removing resources prior to next iteration

Solution lambda L is initialized by observing resource limits.  The incremental cost LMIN associated with the cheapest resource at its minimum limit and the incremental cost LMAX associated with the most expensive resource at its maximum limit are used in the initial guess of L.  When the previous solution is within these limits, its value is used as L(0); otherwise L(0) is computed by bisection as follows:

L(0) = (LMAX + LMIN)/2

Postulation of lambda between iterations utilizes the slope of the composite incremental cost curve at the current guess of lambda:

L(new) = L(prev) + (DMW-Sum p)/INVSLP

where:	L(new)	-	new guess of lambda
L(prev)	-	previous iteration guess of lambda
INVSLP	-	inverse slope of the composite cost curve at L(prev)
= sum (inverse(unit ICC slopes))
DMW		-	total desired dispatch MW
Sum p		-	sum of base points at previous iteration

Resources are dispatched at the current guess for solution lambda.  Each dispatched MW level is constrained by the unit dispatch limits; when the dispatch level is beyond a limit, it is set to that limit.

Upon comparison of DMW and the sum of base points, it can be determined if the current guess of lambda results in too much generation or too little generation.  In certain situations, units can be removed from further calculations.  This technique improves the performance of the solution.  The positive slope characteristic of the unit ICC's allows this assumption.

The following outline illustrates the solution procedure:

170,2016,12,0,100,,"Economic Dispatch Solution Module (EDSOL)
Given a system total generation requirement, EDSOL determines the most economical generation level for all
generators under economic dispatch control, taking into account the generators input-output characteristics,
the generators fuel costs and the power losses over the transmission network.
A generating unit's input-output characteristics relate the fuel rate input, MBTU/HR, to the generator's power
output (MW). This is usually known as the heat rate curve. The incremental heat rate curve, as the name
implies, relates the incremental fuel rate input, MBTU/MWHR, to the generator's power output. Multiplying by
the generator's selected fuel's cost, $/MBTU, the generator's incremental cost curve is obtained ($/MWHR vs.
MW). The generator's efficiency value (in percent) is also incorporated (by normalization and division) into the
determination of the generator's incremental cost curve coefficients. The incremental heat rate curve is
linearized and defined by up to eighteen straight- line segments. Each segment is defined by its two end
points.
Mathematically, the economic dispatch problem can be expressed as the minimization of the generation cost,
which is defined as:
C = S ci (Pi) (1)
Where
C = generation cost
Pi = output power of generator i
ci (Pi) = fuel cost for Pi
Subject to the following constraints:
Pmini £ Pi £ Pmaxi (2)
S Pi = Load + Loss (P1. Pi, ...) (3)
Where
Pmini = minimum power of generator i
Pmaxi = maximum power of generator i
Load = system load
Loss = line losses
Now, consider the augmented Lagrange cost function:
£ = C - l (S Pi - Load - Loss) (4)
The optimal solution is given by:
¶£ = 0
¶Pi (5)
i.e., ¶Ci (Pi) - l (1 - ¶ Loss) = 0
¶ Pi ¶ Pi
Which gives the optimal coordination equations:
l = Pfi ¶Ci (Pi) (6)
¶Pi
Where
Pfi = 1 is the penalty factor of generator i.
1 - ¶ Loss
¶ Pi
Equation (6) shows that the optimal dispatch is achieved when all generators operate at equal incremental
cost l.
Calculating the penalty factors Pfi, which are a measure of transmission losses, requires the solution of load
flow equations.
The Economic Dispatch Solution routine's (EDSOL's) caller normally obtains the penalty factors from the
database as calculated by Network Analysis. They can alternately be set by the user or set to unity (1.0).
Any Power Application that provides the appropriate set of input data can utilize EDSOL routine. The caller
can optionally direct EDSOL to obtain certain input data, such as generators incremental heat rate curves
coefficients and generators fuel selections and costs, directly from the appropriate database tables.
EDSOL begins its processing by adjusting the caller's total required generation to reflect the outputs available
from off-control or from base loaded generators. The adjusted value is EDSOL's total required generation
from among the economically dispatched generators. In the case of the Economic Dispatch Control (EDC)
calling EDSOL, EDSOL develops its total required generation by summing the current actual MW outputs of
the economically dispatched generators.
If EDSOL finds that its total required generation can not be satisfied due to being out of range of the EDC High
or EDC Low limits sum, then each dispatched generator's desired generation value is set equal to the
appropriate EDC limit before returning to the caller. EDSOL also returns the appropriate solution status
indication, which the caller can check to detect and possibly act upon (such as by alerting the dispatcher or
user) the situation.
EDSOL develops each dispatched generator's incremental cost curve coefficients, as described above, and
determines the system's maximum and minimum possible values of Lambda as the initial bounds of the
iterative Lambda search.
The set of simultaneous equations described above is solved iteratively by establishing a trial value of Lambda
to calculate each dispatched generator's desired power output and the system sum of the desired power
outputs. If the system sum of the desired power outputs matches (within a designated tolerance) EDSOL's
total required generation, then the iterative Lambda search terminates. Otherwise, the trial value of Lambda is
adjusted (using a binary search protected Newton's method adjustment) and another iteration's calculations
are performed. The output of the terminated Lambda search is a tentative set of desired output values that are
within the generators EDC High and EDC Low limits and will satisfy EDSOL's total required generation.
Each generator's tentative desired output is checked against the generator's designated and calculated
disallowed regions. If one or more generator's tentative desired output is found to be within a disallowed
region, then one such generator is selected to have its desired output subsequently clamped to the
appropriate edge of the disallowed region. With that generator effectively removed from the solution
calculations, EDSOL returns to again perform the iterative Lambda search among the reduced set of
economically dispatched generators, and then again check for the need to move a generator's desired output
value out of a disallowed region.
The disallowed regions check loop is terminated once EDSOL finds that no generator's desired output lies
within a disallowed region.
If it is not possible to find a closely matching economic dispatch solution (the designated or calculated
disallowed regions cause the economic dispatch solution problem to be excessively constrained), then
EDSOL returns the appropriate solution status indication to the caller.
EDSOL returns to the caller the calculated value of Lambda and the set of desired outputs for the
economically dispatched generators. Other data is also made available for the caller, such as the solution's
status indication (Normal In Range Solution, Constrained By EDC High Limits Sum, etc.), a list of the indices
of the economically dispatched generators and the set of calculated (pseudo) disallowed regions to be avoided
to limit the starting or stopping of mills.",0

Where: DG is normally FACE, but is limited to the maximum MW all units on control may move 
             during the interval between EDC executions.  DG always has the same sign as FACE.






The EDC routine consists of an inner and outer loop.  The inner loop is a binary search routine for solving the coordination equations in order to obtain base points for a fixed value of LAMBDA.

During this solution it is necessary, of course, to recognize the high and low economic limits and the calculated high and low rate limits.  Once the base points have been determined an outer loop calculation is made to see if the power balance equation is satisfied.  If not, LAMBDA is adjusted, the inner loop is then reentered and a new set of base points calculated.

This procedure will continue until one of these conditions is met:

Both the coordination equations and the power balance equation are satisfied to within
specified tolerances.

2.     Either the coordination equations or the power balance equation does not converse because of    
        numerical or physical problems.  In this case a message is sent to the system console.


Assuming that a valid solution is obtained, the economic participation factors are computed for those units, which are to follow load.  The base points and economic participation factors (for the load following units) are then updated for use by the AGC routines.  The economic participation factors for the units which are not load following are set to zero.

Economic participation factors are calculated by assuming that the slope of the LAMBDA versus generation curve is constant over a short range.  The load is increased by a percentage, DELEDC, and a new dispatch is made.  Economic participation factors for load above the sum of base points are then calculated:

UEPFUPj   =   (change in unitj generation)/
                         (change in system load)

The load is then decreased to the same percentage below its original value, and a new dispatch is made.  Economic participation factors for load below the sum of base points are calculated in the same way as the increasing ones.

EDC utilizes the Auto-Ranging Binary Search method.  It operates by dividing the search region into two, deciding which half the desired result is in, dividing that half into two, and so on until a solution is obtained.  Starting with the desired generation DESGEN (= sum of all generation from telemetry  +  FACE) and an initial value of LAMBDA (usually the value from the last EDC), the calculation proceeds until the error (MWn-DESGEN) is less than a set fraction of DESGEN.  This fraction, ERRTPW, resides in the database.

The binary search algorithm will always work for the Economic Dispatch Calculation when given a realistic set of conditions.  Discontinuous heat rate curve is also supported.  Discontinuous curves have slopes that are infinite at certain points.

Description of Economic Dispatch - System Lambda

Duke’s approach to economic dispatch involves the iterative process of evaluating system incremental costs, unit generation levels, and system load requirements.  The theory behind economic dispatch is to operate the generation units at an equal incremental cost (adjusted for transmission losses) to minimize system costs.  The process is conceptually described as follows:

1.    Select a system incremental cost to evaluate based on system load requirements.
2.    Use the selected system incremental cost to calculate unit incremental costs using unit penalty factors.  Unit penalty factors relate unit generation levels to system transmission losses.
3.    Calculate unit generation levels using the unit incremental cost and unit incremental cost curves.
4.    Sum up unit generation levels to get system generation.
5.    Compare system generation to system load requirements.
6.    If system generation is less than system load requirements, select a new system incremental cost that is greater than the previous system incremental cost.  If system generation is greater than system load requirement, select a new system incremental cost that is less than the previous system incremental cost.
7.    Return to step 2 and continue the process.

Once system generation equals the system load requirements (within a small deadband), the economic dispatch process is complete.  The last system incremental cost is system lambda, and the last unit generation levels are the optimal generation levels.

Description of Econmic Dispatch

Calculation of System Lambda

The goal of economic dispatch is to match the electric power resoures with electricty demand in near real-time on a least incremental cost basis.  For the given system generation requirement, the cheapest operating point occurs where the incremental power cost (lambda) for each controllable unit is equal, save any unit limitations.  The mathematical derivation proving the merits of equal lambda dispatch may be found in most power system analysis text books.  The controller must therefore be able to find the right system lambda and the desired generation of each unit at that lambda.

Economic (equal lambda) dispatch at Duke Energy Progress, LLC is achieved with the use of unit incremental heat-rate curves, fuel costs, emissions cost, variable O&M and penalty factors for transmission losses.  The increamental cost curve for each generatng unit is the product of the incremental heat-rate curve (that considers emissions per MBTU of heat input) multiplied by the penalty factor to account for transmission losses.  An iterative process of selecting a system lambda target and determining each unit's MW output at that target until the demand requirement is achieved is constantly  employed by the Energy Management System.  As demand changes and as unscheduled PURPA solar is injected into the system, a new system lambda is calculated in order to economically match dispatchable generation with the new demand requirements.  The hourly system lambda is subsequently the average of the respective system lambda results from the economic dipatch calculation.  Additionally, each unit's economical MW output target is further offset in an attempt to maintain an ACE in compliance with applicable NERC Reliablility Standards and such as not to be a burden to the Interconnection, thus fulfilling the Balancing Authority requirement.",0

Description of PNM Balancing Authority Economic Dispatch

PNM Balancing Authority Economic Dispatch 

Since there are no agreements for PNM economic dispatch of non-PNM generation resources within the PNM Balancing Authority, each utility within the PNM Balancing Authority independently performs economic dispatch of their own generation resources.  The majority of PNM Balancing Authority generation resources belong to PNM.  PNM generation resources are economically dispatched as follows:

PNM purchases under long term PPA (Prior Purchase Adjustment), the entire output of the New Mexico Wind Energy Center (204 MWs) and the Red Mesa Wind farm (100MWs). This resource is dispatched as must take.

PNM Palo Verde nuclear generation is the lowest cost PNM generation resource.   Palo Verde is a base loaded non dispatchable resource and is always considered must take.

PNM San Juan generation is typically the next lowest cost PNM generation resource.  The San Juan units,when available, operate in  Automatic Generation Control mode to follow the instantaneous changes in system load and changes to interconnected frequency in response to PNM’s area control error (ACE).   With the retirement of San Juan units 2 and 3 in December 2017, PNM’s ownership of San Juan is spread over two (2) units.  

PNM Four Corners generation is usually PNM's next resource in the dispatch stack.  It does not provide AGC. Four Corners unit 4 and 5 are typically base loaded, however are dispatchable to aid in intra hour system balancing.   

PNM owns one third of the Luna Energy Facility.  This is a two on one combined cycle gas unit with an optimum heat rate of 7200.  This Luna unit is on Automatic Generation Control (AGC) and is dispatched in economic basis.

PNM owns 100% of the Afton Power Plant.  This plant is a one on one combined cycle gas plant with an optimum heat rate of 7200.

Lordsburg Generating Station consists of are two quick start gas turbines located in southern New Mexico, owned and operated by PNM.  It is primarily used to cover PNM system contingency reserves requirements or is used to serve southern New Mexico load when transmission constraints occur limiting transfer capability between PNM’s northern system.

La Luz plant is located in northern New Mexico, owned and operated by PNM.  It is the same technology as the Lordsburg plants and is used in the same manner.

PNM Reeves is a gas plant located in Albuquerque.  It is started for load, for spinning reserves resources, for loadside used for transmission support, and for energy sales, if its operating costs are within the range of spot market costs.

Valencia is a gas plant located south of Albuquerque.  Its total output is purchased by PNM on a long term PPA.  It is started for load, for reserves, for load side used for transmission support, and for energy sales.  .  

Rio Bravo is a gas/oil plant located in Albuquerque.  It is owned and operated by PNM.   It is started for load or for loadside used for transmission support.  Rio Bravo also has quick start capability and is brought online to aid in recovering from a contingency event. 

PNM owns over 100 MWs of Solar generation that were added to PNM’s renewable generation portfolio.  The Facilities are geographically dispersed throughout PNM’s Balancing Authority area.  While these resources are not economically dispatched, they are included in daily unit commitments.

PNM System Lambda Calculation

Since PNM is not able to economically dispatch non-PNM Balancing Authority generation resources, the System Lambda calculation only includes PNM generation resources.  If generation resources having an incremental fuel cost less than the calculated San Juan lambda are being curtailed, the PNM Real Time Power Trader manually schedules the lower cost resource to replace the higher lambda San Juan resource.  The calculated San Juan lambda value is manually replaced with the lower value.  If the PNM San Juan generation resource is fully scheduled, except for unloaded capacity needed for regulation and contingency reserves, and PNM is using generation resources having a higher incremental fuel cost (such as purchased energy with a higher cost than the San Juan lambda), the PNM Real Time Power Trader replaces the previously calculated lambda value with the cost of the next incremental generation resource available to PNM.

116,2017,12,0,100,,"5.5  Economic Allocation - Lambda Dispatch

The Lambda algorithm function determines generator base points and allocates additional reserve to determine new dispatch limits prior to the final base point calculation.

The classical Lambda algorithm solution technique is employed along with additional features that are described below.  The algorithm solution provides a set of generation levels and inverse slopes of the incremental cost curve.  The slope values are later applied for the determination of economic participation factors.

The following notation is used:

	P	-	generation MW for a unit being dispatched
	Sum p	-	Sum of individual p values being dispatched
	DMW	-	total dispatch MW
	c	-	generator unit cost curve; c(p) = cost at p output
	L	-	Lagrange multiplier whose solution value will be the solution Lambda 


5.5.1  Classical Iterative Approach

The objective of the Lambda algorithm is to find a set of generation p values at minimum total cost for a given desired MW value, DMW:

	DMW = SUM p

Since the total cost function is the sum of individual (non-linear) cost functions, the classical Lagrange multiplier method minimizes the augmented cost function F:

	F = Sum c(p) + L * (Sum p - PD - TL)

subject to:

	MNDP = p = MXDP

where:	c		-	cost function of generation p
	L		-	Lambda (Lagrange multiplier)
	PD		-	total system load or demand; constant
	TL		-	total transmission losses which is a function of p
	MXDP,MNDP	-	given dispatch limits

For the solution set of p values, the term (Sum p - PD - TL) is zero and F will be the minimum total cost.

The minimum of F is determined when each first derivative of F with respect to generator i, df/dp(i), is zero.  The solution criterion is met by the simultaneous solution of the following coordination equations:

	(dC(1)/dP(1)) * PF(1) = L
	(dC(2)/dP(2)) * PF(2) = L
 	.	
 	.
 	.
	(dC(n)/dP(n)) * PF(n) = L

where:	dC(i)/dP(i)	-	dc/dp, incremental cost c of unit i at generation level P
	PF(i)	-	1/(1 - dTL/dP(i))
		-	penalty factor as function of the incremental transmission loss for generator i, dTL/dP(i)
	L	-	incremental cost at delivered power, Lambda

These equations state that the incremental cost of delivered power is equal for all dispatched resources.  The penalty factor takes into account the cost of transferring the generated power to the load center.  The penalty factors are assembled by the ED data processing function from one of four sets of penalty factors and entered dispatch (multiplier) factors found in the database.

The MW output of each generator is obtained from its incremental cost curve for the iteration lambda.  If the MW value is outside of the unit dispatch limits, the output is held at the appropriate limit.

5.5.2  Additional Features

Additional features enhance the classical Lambda dispatch algorithm.  These features are:

	fixing and removing resources from iterations

	Lambda postulate algorithm

The fixing and removing of units from further iterations is performed when the previous iteration does not converge to the solution.  This process consists of recognizing the over- or under-generating state of the previous iteration pass.  At this point, the units are fixed at their high limits in the under-generating state and removed from the iterative loop, since their dispatch levels would not change in further iterations.  Units are fixed at their low limits in the over-generating state in a similar fashion.

In the Lambda algorithm, the composite slope at the previous lambda from units remaining in the iteration loop is applied as part of the first-order Taylor's approximation of lambda:

	L(new) = L(prev) + m' * MWERROR

subject to dynamic high and low lambda limits LMAX and LMIN:

	LMIN £ L(new) £ LMAX

where:	m'	- slope of the composite incremental cost curve
	L( )	- lambda postulate
	MWERROR	- the excess of (over-generation) or lack of (under-generation) dispatch MW's
	LMAX	- L(prev) when L(new) will be smaller
	LMIN	- L(prev) when L(new) will be larger

By constraining L within LMAX and LMIN, a diverging solution is prevented.  If the new L fails the limit test, it is not set to the limit but rather is recomputed by bisection:

	L(new) = (LMAX + LMIN)/2

5.5.3  Coordination Equations Solution

The solution of the coordination equations proceeds in an iterative fashion.  The major steps in the solution include:

	postulation of solution lambda L

	derivation of unit dispatch MW from the ICC for all units

	decision as to the necessity for another iteration (by comparing total dispatched MW to total desired MW)

	fixing and removing resources prior to next iteration

Solution lambda L is initialized by observing resource limits.  The incremental cost LMIN associated with the cheapest resource at its minimum limit and the incremental cost LMAX associated with the most expensive resource at its maximum limit are used in the initial guess of L.  When the previous solution is within these limits, its value is used as L(0); otherwise L(0) is computed by bisection as follows:

	L(0) = (LMAX + LMIN)/2

Postulation of lambda between iterations utilizes the slope of the composite incremental cost curve at the current guess of lambda:

	L(new) = L(prev) + (DMW-Sum p)/INVSLP

where:	L(new)	-	new guess of lambda
	L(prev)	-	previous iteration guess of lambda
	INVSLP	-	inverse slope of the composite cost curve at L(prev)
			= sum (inverse(unit ICC slopes))
	DMW	-	total desired dispatch MW
	Sum p	-	sum of base points at previous iteration

Resources are dispatched at the current guess for solution lambda.  Each dispatched MW level is constrained by the unit dispatch limits; when the dispatch level is beyond a limit, it is set to that limit.

Upon comparison of DMW and the sum of base points, it can be determined if the current guess of lambda results in too much generation or too little generation.  In certain situations, units can be removed from further calculations.  This technique improves the performance of the solution.  The positive slope characteristic of the unit ICC's allows this assumption.

157,2017,12,0,100,,"Duke Energy’s approach to economic dispatch involves the iterative process of evaluating 
system incremental costs, unit generation levels, and system load requirements.  
The theory behind economic dispatch is to operate the generation units at an equal 
incremental cost (adjusted for transmission losses) to minimize system costs.  
The process is conceptually described as follows:

Select a system incremental cost to evaluate based on system load requirements.
Use the selected system incremental cost to calculate unit incremental costs using unit penalty factors.  Unit penalty factors relate unit generation levels to system transmission losses.  
Calculate unit generation levels using the unit incremental cost and unit incremental cost curves.  
Sum up unit generation levels to get system generation. 
Compare system generation to system load requirements.
If system generation is less than system load requirements, select a new system incremental cost that is greater than the previous system incremental cost.  If system generation is greater than system load requirement, select a new system incremental cost that is less than the previous system incremental cost.
Return to step 2 and continue the process.

Once system generation equals the system load requirements (within a small dead band), the economic dispatch process is complete.The last system incremental cost is system lambda, and the last unit generation levels are the optimal generation levels.

This base price is determined at the NYISO reference bus, so named because it is the reference against which losses, congestion, shift factors, penalty factors and other system mathematical quantities are calculated.  It is physically located at the Marcy 345 kV substation in Marcy, New York.  In transmitting energy across the state, there are additional costs for the electrical losses and sometimes for congestion when transmission lines become overloaded.  The DAM zonal Local Based marginal Prices are determined by adding the marginal cost of energy, the marginal cost of losses and the marginal cost of congestion.

233,2017,12,0,100,,"Calculation of System lambda

The goal of economic dispatch is to match electric power resources with electricity demand in near real-time on a least incremental cost basis.  For a given system generation requirement, the cheapest operating point occurs where the incremental power cost (lambda) for each controllable unit is equal save any unit limitations.  The mathematical derivation proving the merits of equal lambda dispatch may be found in most power system analysis text books.  The controller must therefore be able to find the right system lambda and the desired generation of each unit at that lambda.

Economic (equal lambda) dispatch at Duke Energy Progress, LLC  is achieved with the use of unit incremental heat-rate curves, fuel costs, emissions costs, variable O&M and penalty factors for transmission losses.  The incremental cost curve for each generating unit is the product of the incremental heat rate curve (that considers emissions per MBTU of heat input) multiplied by the unit fuel cost, augmented by the associated unit’s variable O&M, and then multiplied by the penalty factor to account for transmission losses.  An iterative process of selecting a system lambda target and determining each unit’s MW output at that target until the demand requirement is achieved is constantly employed by the Energy Management System.  As demand changes and as unscheduled PURPA solar is injected into the system, a new system lambda is calculated in order to economically match dispatchable generation with the new demand requirement.  The hourly system lambda is subsequently the average of the respective system lambda results from the economic dispatch calculation.  Additionally, each unit’s economical MW output target is further offset in an attempt to maintain an ACE in compliance with applicable NERC Reliability Standards and such as not to be a burden to the Interconnection, thus fulfilling the Balancing Authority requirement.

The EDC routine consists of an inner and outer loop.  The inner loop is a binary search routine for solving the coordination equations in order to obtain base points for a fixed value of LAMBDA.

During this solution it is necessary, of course, to recognize the high and low economic limits and the calculated high and low rate limits.  Once the base points have been determined an outer loop calculation is made to see if the power balance equation is satisfied.  If not, LAMBDA is adjusted, the inner loop is then reentered and a new set of base points calculated.

This procedure will continue until one of these conditions is met:

Both the coordination equations and the power balance equation are satisfied to within
specified tolerances.

2.     Either the coordination equations or the power balance equation does not converse because of    
        numerical or physical problems.  In this case a message is sent to the system console.


Assuming that a valid solution is obtained, the economic participation factors are computed for those units, which are to follow load.  The base points and economic participation factors (for the load following units) are then updated for use by the AGC routines.  The economic participation factors for the units which are not load following are set to zero.

Economic participation factors are calculated by assuming that the slope of the LAMBDA versus generation curve is constant over a short range.  The load is increased by a percentage, DELEDC, and a new dispatch is made.  Economic participation factors for load above the sum of base points are then calculated:

UEPFUPj   =   (change in unitj generation)/
                         (change in system load)

The load is then decreased to the same percentage below its original value, and a new dispatch is made.  Economic participation factors for load below the sum of base points are calculated in the same way as the increasing ones.

EDC utilizes the Auto-Ranging Binary Search method.  It operates by dividing the search region into two, deciding which half the desired result is in, dividing that half into two, and so on until a solution is obtained.  Starting with the desired generation DESGEN (= sum of all generation from telemetry  +  FACE) and an initial value of LAMBDA (usually the value from the last EDC), the calculation proceeds until the error (MWn-DESGEN) is less than a set fraction of DESGEN.  This fraction, ERRTPW, resides in the database.

The binary search algorithm will always work for the Economic Dispatch Calculation when given a realistic set of conditions.  Discontinuous heat rate curve is also supported.  Discontinuous curves have slopes that are infinite at certain points.

Description of PNM Balancing Authority Economic Dispatch

PNM Balancing Authority Economic Dispatch 

Since there are no agreements for PNM economic dispatch of non-PNM generation resources within the PNM Balancing Authority, each utility within the PNM Balancing Authority independently performs economic dispatch of their own generation resources.  The majority of PNM Balancing Authority generation resources belong to PNM.  PNM generation resources are economically dispatched as follows:

PNM purchases under long term PPAs (Power Purchase Agreements), the entire output of the New Mexico Wind Energy Center and Casa Mesa Wind farm (limited by a transmission interconnect agreement to 200 MWs) and the Red Mesa Wind farm (100MWs). These resources are dispatched as must take.

PNM Palo Verde nuclear generation is the lowest cost PNM generation resource.   Palo Verde is a base loaded non dispatchable resource and is always considered must take.

PNM San Juan generation is typically the next lowest cost PNM generation resource.  The San Juan units, when available, operate in Automatic Generation Control (AGC) mode to follow the instantaneous changes in system load and changes to interconnected frequency in response to PNM’s area control error (ACE).   With the retirement of San Juan units 2 and 3 in December 2017, PNM’s ownership of San Juan is spread over the two remaining units.  

PNM Four Corners generation is usually PNM's next resource in the dispatch stack.  It does not provide AGC. Four Corners unit 4 and 5 are typically base loaded, however are dispatchable to aid in intra hour system balancing.   

PNM owns one third of the Luna Energy Facility.  This is a two on one combined cycle gas unit with an optimum heat rate of 7200.  This Luna unit is on AGC to follow the instantaneous changes in system load and changes to interconnected frequency in response to PNM’s ACE.

PNM owns 100% of the Afton Power Plant.  This plant is a one on one combined cycle gas plant with an optimum heat rate of 7200.

Lordsburg Generating Station consists of two quick start gas turbines located in southern New Mexico and is owned and operated by PNM.  It is primarily used to cover PNM system contingency reserves requirements or is used to serve the southern New Mexico load when transmission constraints occur limiting transfer capability between PNM’s northern system.

La Luz plant is located in northern New Mexico and is owned and operated by PNM.  It is the same technology as the Lordsburg plants and is used in the same manner.

PNM Reeves is a gas plant located in Albuquerque.  It is started for load, for spinning reserves resources, for loadside used for transmission support, and for energy sales if its operating costs are within the range of spot market costs.

Valencia is a gas plant located south of Albuquerque.  Its total output is purchased by PNM on a long term PPA.  It is started for load, for reserves, for load side used for transmission support, and for energy sales.  

Rio Bravo is a gas/oil plant located in Albuquerque.  It is owned and operated by PNM.   It is started for load or for loadside used for transmission support.  Rio Bravo also has quick start capability and is brought online to aid in recovering from a contingency event. 

As a southern New Mexico resource, D Burgett Geo Thermal plant provides PNM with 13 MWs of capability through a PPA. While this resource is not economically dispatched, it is included in daily unit commitments.  
                                                                                                                              
PNM owns over 100 MWs of solar generation that were added to PNM’s renewable generation portfolio.  The facilities are geographically dispersed throughout PNM’s Balancing Authority area.  While these resources are not economically dispatched, they are included in daily unit commitments.

PNM System Lambda Calculation

Since PNM is not able to economically dispatch non-PNM Balancing Authority generation resources, the System Lambda calculation only includes PNM generation resources.  If generation resources having an incremental fuel cost less than the calculated San Juan lambda are being curtailed, the PNM Real Time Power Trader manually schedules the lower cost resource to replace the higher lambda San Juan resource.  The calculated San Juan lambda value is manually replaced with the lower value.  If the PNM San Juan generation resource is fully scheduled, except for unloaded capacity needed for regulation and contingency reserves, and PNM is using generation resources having a higher incremental fuel cost (such as purchased energy with a higher cost than the San Juan lambda), the PNM Real Time Power Trader replaces the previously calculated lambda value with the cost of the next incremental generation resource available to PNM.

The following notation is used:

P			-	generation MW for a unit being dispatched
Sum p	-	Sum of individual p values being dispatched
DMW	-	total dispatch MW
c			-	generator unit cost curve; c(p) = cost at p output
L			-	Lagrange multiplier whose solution value will be the solution Lambda 

5.5.1  Classical Iterative Approach

The objective of the Lambda algorithm is to find a set of generation p values at minimum total cost for a given desired MW value, DMW:

DMW = SUM p

Since the total cost function is the sum of individual (non-linear) cost functions, the classical Lagrange multiplier method minimizes the augmented cost function F:

F = Sum c(p) + L * (Sum p - PD - TL)

subject to:

MNDP £ p £MXDP

where:	c						-	cost function of generation p
L						-	Lambda (Lagrange multiplier)
PD					-	total system load or demand; constant
TL					-	total transmission losses which is a function of p
MXDP,MNDP	-	given dispatch limits

For the solution set of p values, the term (Sum p - PD - TL) is zero and F will be the minimum total cost.

The minimum of F is determined when each first derivative of F with respect to generator i, df/dp(i), is zero.  The solution criterion is met by the simultaneous solution of the following coordination equations:

(dC(1)/dP(1)) * PF(1) = L
(dC(2)/dP(2)) * PF(2) = L
 .
 .
 .
(dC(n)/dP(n)) * PF(n) = L

where:	dC(i)/dP(i)	-	dc/dp, incremental cost c of unit i at generation level P
PF(i)			-	1/(1 - dTL/dP(i))
-	penalty factor as function of the incremental transmission loss for generator i, dTL/dP(i)
L					-	incremental cost at delivered power, Lambda

These equations state that the incremental cost of delivered power is equal for all dispatched resources.  The penalty factor takes into account the cost of transferring the generated power to the load center.  The penalty factors are assembled by the ED data processing function from one of four sets of penalty factors and entered dispatch (multiplier) factors found in the database.

The MW output of each generator is obtained from its incremental cost curve for the iteration lambda.  If the MW value is outside of the unit dispatch limits, the output is held at the appropriate limit.

5.5.2  Additional Features

Additional features enhance the classical Lambda dispatch algorithm.  These features are:

·	fixing and removing resources from iterations

·	Lambda postulate algorithm

The fixing and removing of units from further iterations is performed when the previous iteration does not converge to the solution.  This process consists of recognizing the over- or under-generating state of the previous iteration pass.  At this point, the units are fixed at their high limits in the under-generating state and removed from the iterative loop, since their dispatch levels would not change in further iterations.  Units are fixed at their low limits in the over-generating state in a similar fashion.

In the Lambda algorithm, the composite slope at the previous lambda from units remaining in the iteration loop is applied as part of the first-order Taylor's approximation of lambda:

L(new) = L(prev) + m' * MWERROR

subject to dynamic high and low lambda limits LMAX and LMIN:

LMIN £ L(new) £ LMAX

where:	m'				-	slope of the composite incremental cost curve
L( )				-	lambda postulate
MWERROR	-	the excess of (over-generation) or lack of (under-generation) dispatch MW's
LMAX		-	L(prev) when L(new) will be smaller
LMIN			-	L(prev) when L(new) will be larger
By constraining L within LMAX and LMIN, a diverging solution is prevented.  If the new L fails the limit test, it is not set to the limit but rather is recomputed by bisection:

L(new) = (LMAX + LMIN)/2

5.5.3  Coordination Equations Solution

The solution of the coordination equations proceeds in an iterative fashion.  The major steps in the solution include:

·	postulation of solution lambda L

·	derivation of unit dispatch MW from the ICC for all units

·	decision as to the necessity for another iteration (by comparing total dispatched MW to total desired MW)

·	fixing and removing resources prior to next iteration

Solution lambda L is initialized by observing resource limits.  The incremental cost LMIN associated with the cheapest resource at its minimum limit and the incremental cost LMAX associated with the most expensive resource at its maximum limit are used in the initial guess of L.  When the previous solution is within these limits, its value is used as L(0); otherwise L(0) is computed by bisection as follows:

L(0) = (LMAX + LMIN)/2

Postulation of lambda between iterations utilizes the slope of the composite incremental cost curve at the current guess of lambda:

L(new) = L(prev) + (DMW-Sum p)/INVSLP

where:	L(new)	-	new guess of lambda
L(prev)	-	previous iteration guess of lambda
INVSLP	-	inverse slope of the composite cost curve at L(prev)
= sum (inverse(unit ICC slopes))
DMW		-	total desired dispatch MW
Sum p		-	sum of base points at previous iteration

Resources are dispatched at the current guess for solution lambda.  Each dispatched MW level is constrained by the unit dispatch limits; when the dispatch level is beyond a limit, it is set to that limit.

Upon comparison of DMW and the sum of base points, it can be determined if the current guess of lambda results in too much generation or too little generation.  In certain situations, units can be removed from further calculations.  This technique improves the performance of the solution.  The positive slope characteristic of the unit ICC's allows this assumption.

The following outline illustrates the solution procedure:

Description of Economic Dispatch

Calculation of System lambda

The goal of economic dispatch is to match electric power resources with electricity demand in near real-time on a least incremental cost basis.  For a given system generation requirement, the cheapest operating point occurs where the incremental power cost (lambda) for each controllable unit is equal save any unit limitations.  The mathematical derivation proving the merits of equal lambda dispatch may be found in most power system analysis textbooks.  The controller must therefore be able to find the right system lambda and the desired generation of each unit at that lambda.

Economic (equal lambda) dispatch at Duke Energy Carolinas, LLC and Duke Energy Progress, LLC is achieved with the use of unit incremental heat-rate curves, fuel costs, emissions costs, variable O&M and penalty factors for transmission losses.  The incremental cost curve for each generating unit is the product of the incremental heat-rate curve (that considers emissions per MBTU of heat input) multiplied by the unit fuel cost, augmented by the associated unit’s variable O&M, and then multiplied by the penalty factor to account for transmission losses.  An iterative process of selecting a system lambda target and determining each unit’s MW output at that target until the demand requirement is achieved is constantly employed by the Energy Management System.  As demand changes, a new system lambda is calculated in order to economically match dispatchable generation with the new demand requirement.  The hourly system lambda is subsequently the average of the respective system lambda results from the economic dispatch calculation.  Additionally, each unit’s economical MW output target is further offset in an attempt to maintain an ACE in compliance with applicable NERC Reliability Standards and such as not to be a burden to the Interconnection, thus fulfilling the Balancing Authority requirement.

This technique used each unit's incremental production cost curve in coordination with computed penalty factors to determine the optimum economic loading of dispatchable on-line units. A system incremental cost curve is calculated to relate system cost, lambda ($MWH), to required generation (MW). This cost curve is computed using the unit's incremental heat rate curves, fuel costs, operations and maintenance, efficiency factors, and incremental transmission losses. System lambda only includes the incremetnal cost of units under Automatic Generation Control (AGC).",0

The Seattle Energy Management System uses an arbitrarily set water worth value to derive a system lambda which feeds the Economic Dispatch function.  The water worth values are set to essentially place more value on the water of an upstream dam than a downstream dam as the water can be passed through multiple generators. The Economic Dispatch function uses generator performance curves to allocate generation in the most economic manner for those units that are in the economic dispatch mode.  As Seattle’s generators and plants on the Skagit project are not hydraulically matched and there are seasonal flow constraints for fish protection, not all units can be operated in the economic dispatch mode. Seattle normally strives to fully utilize its hydro storage and peaking capability at both its Boundary and Skagit Projects.  During the light load hours, we normally take in lower priced energy into our system, operate our Skagit Project to near minimum license requirements (fish flow minimum), and completely shut down our Boundary Project.  With the exception of the spring run off season, Boundary's entire daily inflow is used to generate only during those sixteen heavy load hours and not the entire day.

Where:  Cj	     = Fuel cost for the jth unit.

             dfj/dpj         = Incremental heat rate for the jth unit.

             IMj               = Incremental maintenance cost for the jth unit.

             PFj               = Penalty Factor for the jth unit.

In addition to the coordination equations, the following power balance equation must be satisfied:

SUM OF    Basepoints of

Where: DG is normally FACE, but is limited to the maximum MW all units on control may move 
             during the interval between EDC executions.  DG always has the same sign as FACE.






The EDC routine consists of an inner and outer loop.  The inner loop is a binary search routine for solving the coordination equations in order to obtain base points for a fixed value of LAMBDA.

During this solution it is necessary, of course, to recognize the high and low economic limits and the calculated high and low rate limits.  Once the base points have been determined an outer loop calculation is made to see if the power balance equation is satisfied.  If not, LAMBDA is adjusted, the inner loop is then reentered and a new set of base points calculated.

This procedure will continue until one of these conditions is met:

Both the coordination equations and the power balance equation are satisfied to within
specified tolerances.

2.     Either the coordination equations or the power balance equation does not converse because of    
        numerical or physical problems.  In this case a message is sent to the system console.


Assuming that a valid solution is obtained, the economic participation factors are computed for those units, which are to follow load.  The base points and economic participation factors (for the load following units) are then updated for use by the AGC routines.  The economic participation factors for the units which are not load following are set to zero.

Economic participation factors are calculated by assuming that the slope of the LAMBDA versus generation curve is constant over a short range.  The load is increased by a percentage, DELEDC, and a new dispatch is made.  Economic participation factors for load above the sum of base points are then calculated:

UEPFUPj   =   (change in unitj generation)/
                         (change in system load)

The load is then decreased to the same percentage below its original value, and a new dispatch is made.  Economic participation factors for load below the sum of base points are calculated in the same way as the increasing ones.

EDC utilizes the Auto-Ranging Binary Search method.  It operates by dividing the search region into two, deciding which half the desired result is in, dividing that half into two, and so on until a solution is obtained.  Starting with the desired generation DESGEN (= sum of all generation from telemetry  +  FACE) and an initial value of LAMBDA (usually the value from the last EDC), the calculation proceeds until the error (MWn-DESGEN) is less than a set fraction of DESGEN.  This fraction, ERRTPW, resides in the database.

The binary search algorithm will always work for the Economic Dispatch Calculation when given a realistic set of conditions.  Discontinuous heat rate curve is also supported.  Discontinuous curves have slopes that are infinite at certain points.

185,2018,12,0,100,,"ISO New England calculates locational marginal prices rather than system lambda. Locational Marginal Price (LMP) is defined as the marginal price for energy at the location where the energy is delivered or received and is made up of three components: the energy component, the congestion component, and the loss component.

LMPs result from the application of a linear optimization method to minimize energy, congestion, and transmission loss costs, given system conditions and constraints, while satisfying energy and operating reserve needs for the entire New England Control Area. The process yields the three components of LMPs:

LMP ($/MW) = Energy Component + Loss Component + Congestion Component

The Energy Component is based on unit-submitted supply offers for generating an amount of MWh for a particular hour.

The Energy Component is the same for all locations. The Loss Component reflects the marginal cost of system losses specific to each location, while the Congestion Component represents the individual location's marginal transmission congestion cost as impacted by all binding constraints including local operating reserve requirements in real time.",0

170,2018,12,0,100,,"Economic Dispatch Solution Module (EDSOL)
Given a system total generation requirement, EDSOL determines the most economical generation level for all
generators under economic dispatch control, taking into account the generators input-output characteristics,
the generators fuel costs and the power losses over the transmission network.
A generating unit's input-output characteristics relate the fuel rate input, MBTU/HR, to the generator's power
output (MW). This is usually known as the heat rate curve. The incremental heat rate curve, as the name
implies, relates the incremental fuel rate input, MBTU/MWHR, to the generator's power output. Multiplying by
the generator's selected fuel's cost, $/MBTU, the generator's incremental cost curve is obtained ($/MWHR vs.
MW). The generator's efficiency value (in percent) is also incorporated (by normalization and division) into the
determination of the generator's incremental cost curve coefficients. The incremental heat rate curve is
linearized and defined by up to eighteen straight- line segments. Each segment is defined by its two end
points.
Mathematically, the economic dispatch problem can be expressed as the minimization of the generation cost,
which is defined as:
C = S ci (Pi) (1)
Where
C = generation cost
Pi = output power of generator i
ci (Pi) = fuel cost for Pi
Subject to the following constraints:
Pmini £ Pi £ Pmaxi (2)
S Pi = Load + Loss (P1. Pi, ...) (3)
Where
Pmini = minimum power of generator i
Pmaxi = maximum power of generator i
Load = system load
Loss = line losses
Now, consider the augmented Lagrange cost function:
£ = C - l (S Pi - Load - Loss) (4)
The optimal solution is given by:
¶£ = 0
¶Pi (5)
i.e., ¶Ci (Pi) - l (1 - ¶ Loss) = 0
¶ Pi ¶ Pi
Which gives the optimal coordination equations:
l = Pfi ¶Ci (Pi) (6)
¶Pi
Where
Pfi = 1 is the penalty factor of generator i.
1 - ¶ Loss
¶ Pi
Equation (6) shows that the optimal dispatch is achieved when all generators operate at equal incremental
cost l.
Calculating the penalty factors Pfi, which are a measure of transmission losses, requires the solution of load
flow equations.
The Economic Dispatch Solution routine's (EDSOL's) caller normally obtains the penalty factors from the
database as calculated by Network Analysis. They can alternately be set by the user or set to unity (1.0).
Any Power Application that provides the appropriate set of input data can utilize EDSOL routine. The caller
can optionally direct EDSOL to obtain certain input data, such as generators incremental heat rate curves
coefficients and generators fuel selections and costs, directly from the appropriate database tables.
EDSOL begins its processing by adjusting the caller's total required generation to reflect the outputs available
from off-control or from base loaded generators. The adjusted value is EDSOL's total required generation
from among the economically dispatched generators. In the case of the Economic Dispatch Control (EDC)
calling EDSOL, EDSOL develops its total required generation by summing the current actual MW outputs of
the economically dispatched generators.
If EDSOL finds that its total required generation can not be satisfied due to being out of range of the EDC High
or EDC Low limits sum, then each dispatched generator's desired generation value is set equal to the
appropriate EDC limit before returning to the caller. EDSOL also returns the appropriate solution status
indication, which the caller can check to detect and possibly act upon (such as by alerting the dispatcher or
user) the situation.
EDSOL develops each dispatched generator's incremental cost curve coefficients, as described above, and
determines the system's maximum and minimum possible values of Lambda as the initial bounds of the
iterative Lambda search.
The set of simultaneous equations described above is solved iteratively by establishing a trial value of Lambda
to calculate each dispatched generator's desired power output and the system sum of the desired power
outputs. If the system sum of the desired power outputs matches (within a designated tolerance) EDSOL's
total required generation, then the iterative Lambda search terminates. Otherwise, the trial value of Lambda is
adjusted (using a binary search protected Newton's method adjustment) and another iteration's calculations
are performed. The output of the terminated Lambda search is a tentative set of desired output values that are
within the generators EDC High and EDC Low limits and will satisfy EDSOL's total required generation.
Each generator's tentative desired output is checked against the generator's designated and calculated
disallowed regions. If one or more generator's tentative desired output is found to be within a disallowed
region, then one such generator is selected to have its desired output subsequently clamped to the
appropriate edge of the disallowed region. With that generator effectively removed from the solution
calculations, EDSOL returns to again perform the iterative Lambda search among the reduced set of
economically dispatched generators, and then again check for the need to move a generator's desired output
value out of a disallowed region.
The disallowed regions check loop is terminated once EDSOL finds that no generator's desired output lies
within a disallowed region.
If it is not possible to find a closely matching economic dispatch solution (the designated or calculated
disallowed regions cause the economic dispatch solution problem to be excessively constrained), then
EDSOL returns the appropriate solution status indication to the caller.
EDSOL returns to the caller the calculated value of Lambda and the set of desired outputs for the
economically dispatched generators. Other data is also made available for the caller, such as the solution's
status indication (Normal In Range Solution, Constrained By EDC High Limits Sum, etc.), a list of the indices
of the economically dispatched generators and the set of calculated (pseudo) disallowed regions to be avoided
to limit the starting or stopping of mills.",0

Imperial Irrigation District is a Balancing Authority Area (BAA) in southern California. IID’s Energy Management System (EMS) monitors load, generation and interchange schedules to maintain a system frequency to 60Hz. IID employs Economic Dispatch to ensure the lowest cost online generating unit will provide the lowest cost megawatt to serve IID’s native load. IID operates its large generating units in Automatic Generation Control (AGC) and in Economic Dispatch. Some of the key imputes in the economic dispatch calculation are fuel price, incremental heat rate and emission cost data. As system load increases, an up pulse will be sent to the generating unit with the lowest incremental cost, thus ensuring system optimization.



On a high level descritpion of economic dispatch:

Lambda is a calculation that determines the cost to produce the next MW needed.  

Economic dispatch will deploy generation from lowest lambda, to highest lambda.  For example:

Generator# 1 has a lambda of $20
Generator# 2 has a lambda of $30
Generator# 3 has a lambda of $40

Economic dispatch will deploy generator# 1 first, then it will deploy generator #2, and lastly it will deploy generator# 3.

Our thermal resources are dispatched on a monthly or weekly basis, depending upon the season. They are typically base-loaded, providing energy to the system. This thermal energy is then shaped with our controllable hydro-electric generating units.

Description of Economic Dispatch


The Southern Company system lambda is determined hourly and is based on the variable
costs of the resources that serve the load obligations of the Operating Companies plus any
sales to third parties.  The variable costs of the resources include the components listed
below, and may also reflect the cost of purchases.  The economic dispatch formula used
to dispatch Southern’s generating resources on the basis of their variable cost components
is as follows:

l  =  [ { (  2aP + b ) * ( FC + EC ) } + VOM + FH ] * TPF

	Where:
	l  	= System lambda
	a, b	= Incremental heat rate coefficients
	P	= Generation level
	FC	= Marginal replacement fuel costs
	EC	= Marginal replacement emission allowance costs
	VOM	= Variable operations and maintenance expenses
	FH	= In-plant fuel handling expenses
	TPF	= Incremental transmission losses (penalty factors)",0
